<p class="caption2">SUBTERRANEAN ICE IN KING&rsquo;S RAVINE.</p>

<p>Subterranean ice was brought to my notice by a
mere accident, late in the month of September, 1877,
while on a descent of King&rsquo;s Ravine, on Mount Adams,
in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. We had
just descended the rock wall of the mountain and had
reached the head of the gorge, when my companion,
Mr. Charles E. Lowe, the well-known Appalachian guide
of Randolph, suddenly said to me, &ldquo;Would you like a
piece of ice? I can get you some presently.&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; wondering where he would find
any. When we got among the big boulders, which form
so rough a path for the traveler at the bottom of the
ravine, Mr. Lowe climbed down under one of the biggest,
and presently reappeared with a good sized lump of
ice. I was much impressed at finding ice at the end
of the summer in this gorge, when for months past no
ice or snow had been visible on the surrounding mountains.
I noticed also the peculiar, flaky formation of the
ice, and saw at once that it was something new to me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
and in fact it was a piece of what I have since learned
to know as &ldquo;prismatic ice.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption3">GLACIÈRE NEAR BRISONS.</p>

<p>In the summer of the year 1880, I traveled through
the Alps, with a friend from Philadelphia. On the 17th
of September, we drove from Geneva to Bonneville.
Thence we started on foot without a guide, and as a
result got lost in the woods, from which we only extricated
ourselves at nightfall. After retracing our steps
to Bonneville, we were glad to find a man to show
us the way we should have taken, and finally reached
the little village of Brisons in France, where we slept.
The next day we took a guide and made our way across
the mountains to Annecy, at one spot going out of our
direct route to see a place spoken of by the natives as
a glacière. It was a little pit, and at the base of one
side thereof was the mouth of a small cave into which
we could not see any distance. At the bottom of the
pit lay a mass of dirty snow and ice to which we did
not descend, as the sides of the pit were sheer and
smooth, and there was no ladder. This pit seemed to
be more of the nature of a gully filled with winter
snow, than a true rock cave containing ice.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE GLACIÈRE DE L&rsquo;HAUT-D&rsquo;AVIERNOZ.</p>

<p>Three days after this, on Tuesday, the 21st of September,
1880, we visited the two largest glacières on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
Mont Parmelan, near Annecy, France. At Annecy we
inquired at the hotel for a man who knew the Mont
Parmelan; and, after finding one, we made our way to
Les Villaz, where we spent the night in an <i>auberge</i>.
Our companion was an odd personage. He was small,
about fifty years of age, and looked meek, crushed and
hungry. He wore a long black frock coat and black
trousers, thin boots and a linen shirt, certainly not the
ideal outfit for a cave explorer. Under his care we
started early in the morning and toiled up a mountain
path some eight hundred or a thousand meters,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> through
woods and pastures, to the higher plateau of Mont Parmelan,
in which was situated the first glacière. This was
in a great pit, at the bottom of which, on one side, was
a big cave. On the side of the pit opposite to the
opening, there was a steep rock slope, forty or fifty
meters long, whose lower portion was covered with snow.
Down this slope we descended with but little difficulty,
reaching at the bottom an almost level ice floor which
spread over the entire cave and was formed throughout
of thick, solid ice. A second and much smaller pit in the
roof of the cave opened directly over the ice floor; and
under this pit rose a small cone of ice, some two meters
high, the only one in this glacière.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The metric system is used throughout this book, except in a few
quotations. Thermometric observations are given in degrees Centigrade.</p></div>

<p>The glacière itself was approximately round in shape,
and some twenty meters in diameter. At one place the
rock wall was broken and we could look into a much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
smaller inner cave or chamber. Into this we could not
penetrate on account of a long, narrow crack or hole
which yawned in the ice floor for a distance of some
five or six meters and continued through the opening
into the second chamber. We tried to cut our way
along the side of the hole, but had to give it up,
finding the ice too hard and our time too short. The
crack or hole, whose sides were solid ice, proved conclusively
that the ice in this glacière was many meters
in thickness, for we could look a long way down into
the hole, certainly for ten or twelve meters, until the
ice sides disappeared in darkness, without any visible
bottom. The hole cannot be spoken of as a crevasse,
for, besides not looking like a crevasse, it was certainly
formed by other causes than those which form
the crevasses in glaciers, since there is, as a rule, no
perceptible movement in subterranean ice. Doubtless,
the hole was due to the drainage of the cave, which
undoubtedly passed off through the hole. There may
be, nevertheless, some little motion in the ice of this
glacière, for it is evident that it is fed principally directly
by the winter snows; which, whether as frozen or melted
snow, descend gradually, by the force of gravitation, from
the slope of the pit into the glacière.</p>

<p>As for any possibility of this great mass of ice melting
away and forming again in any one year, it passes
belief; there must be at least the cubic contents of a
dozen ordinary houses in the cave, and such a mass
could hardly be destroyed or formed again in any such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
short space of time as a fall or spring. This is, therefore,
probably a permanent or perennial glacière.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE GLACIÈRE DE CHAPUIS.</p>

<p>Starting out from the Glacière de l&rsquo;Haut-d&rsquo;Aviernoz
we walked across the plateau of the Mont Parmelan,
<i>en route</i> for the second glacière. This plateau is a curious
rock formation, consisting of what the natives call <i>lapiaz</i>,
which might be translated &ldquo;stone-heaps.&rdquo; The plateau
is full of great projecting rocks; and myriads of cracks
and crevices everywhere rend the surface, and over
these crevices one sometimes has to jump. Still, I do
not remember any particular difficulty. It was certainly
not nearly as bad walking as the taluses of loose rocks
one meets at the base of many mountains.</p>

<p>Our guide led us for about an hour across the plateau
in a southerly direction, and then, looking over the side of
the Parmelan, with a sweep of the arm covering south,
west and north, he told us that the glacière lay between
those points, but he did not know exactly where. This
seemed a rather hopeless prospect, so, as we had no
clue to the whereabouts of our prospective hole, we
descended to a couple of châlets we saw some two
hundred meters below, but which at least were in the
direction of Annecy. We followed a goat-herd&rsquo;s path
which led to the châlets from the plateau, one of those
dangerous grass tracks, where nothing would be easier
than to make a slip, and where a bad slip might have
unpleasant results. This is, however, just the kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
place where every one is particularly careful not to slip.
We were careful and so reached the châlets all right,
and there we found a strong, intelligent boy, who at once
pointed out the place where the glacière was, about
half way up the slope we had just come down. So we
took him with us, leaving our guide at the châlets to
await our return.</p>

<p>The entrance to the glacière was in a wall of rock,
set at an angle of some thirty-five degrees; at the bottom
of this there was some grass. An easy chimney some
fifteen meters high led up to the glacière. Up this chimney
we climbed. At the top we entered a little cave
about two meters deep, by a sort of portal about two
meters wide. The cave made an elbow to the right, and
passing this we found that it turned to the left and
pointed directly into the mountain. The rock went down
vertically in front of us, but the boy said we could get
down, so having first lowered a candle by a string to
see the depth, which turned out to be a perpendicular
drop of some four or five meters, with the help of the
rope we all climbed down. We were already almost
entirely away from the daylight and a few steps took us
into complete darkness, except for the light we had from
the candle each of us held in his hand.</p>

<p>The fissure led straight into the mountain. It was a
couple of meters wide at places, and there we moved
along the bottom. In one place it narrowed below to a
wedge, and there we progressed either by climbing along
one side or by placing one foot on one side and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
other foot on the other. The fissure led downwards as
well as inwards. It would have been nothing in daylight
to go through it; but in the semi-darkness it was not
easy.</p>

<p>After a descent of some twenty-five meters or thereabouts,
we arrived at the glacière, and I have certainly
never seen a weirder place. There was a great arched
rock dome, perhaps six meters in height, and some twelve
in diameter; the floor was a sheet of smooth, slippery ice,
at one end curling over, gently at first, afterwards more
steeply, to a lower depth; and on the sides were seven
or eight ice columns streaming from cracks in the rocks
to the floor. Each of these columns was some three or
four meters high, and, small at the top and in the middle,
spread out at the base into the shape of fans. In
the dim candle light and the cold damp atmosphere, the
columns loomed up like so many ghosts, and the landscape
impression was strange and solemn. The air here
seemed perfectly still.</p>

<p>There was another curiosity. The fissure we had
come down, at this point some three meters wide, was
filled, just beyond the glacière, with pure, transparent
water, which formed a little lake: this was perhaps
one meter deep, and extended across the fissure, barring
further progress. It certainly seems strange that in the
same cavern, under nearly the same conditions of temperature,
there should be one place covered with a flooring of
ice and another filled with water. The explanation, however,
is perhaps not far to seek. Over the lake there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
was a distinct draught of air. The draught probably
melts the ice in summer, if indeed it does not prevent
any from forming in winter. There are, so far, no winter
observations reported of this cave, yet it would seem to
be one which would well repay the trouble.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE GLACIÈRE DE CHAUX-LES-PASSAVANT.</p>

<p>On the 17th of August, 1894, my brother and I arrived
at Besançon, the Vesontio of the Romans, bent on seeing
the Glacière de Chaux-les-Passavant or de la Grâce-Dieu,
which is not far distant from the town. The
hotel we stopped at was pretty bad; the beds were surmounted
with those old-fashioned curtains which were of
use before the invention of glass windows, but which now
only serve to exclude air and ventilation. However, I
learnt something of the manners and customs of the country,
for on getting down at six o&rsquo;clock the next morning
for breakfast, the first question the waiter asked
was: <i>Quel vin monsieur prendra-t-il?</i> At seven o&rsquo;clock
we sallied forth in a little open one-horse victoria, with a
dull gray sky overhead. Besançon is well down in a
valley, so the first five miles of the road were a slow,
gradual rise to the surrounding levels. The scenery
as we drove along reminded us of Turner&rsquo;s pictures:
distant vistas of hills and valleys with factories blowing
off their smoke and with tumble-down old houses
ensconced in picturesque nooks, just those long-distance
effects that Turner loved to paint and which, for some
reason, the artists of the present generation have generally
neglected and usually speak of as unpaintable or unpicturesque.
There was a row of trees, the whole way, on each
side of the road, a bit of practical forestry, the wisdom of
which it would be well for Americans to recognize.
After our poor horse had pulled us up the long hills, we
had an almost level road running in a straight line as far
as the eye could see. We saw at least a hundred little
hawks, who live on field mice and other rodents, and
whose preservation is another evidence of French wisdom.
The last four miles of the drive was up a ravine in the
woods, near the beginning of which we passed the Trappist
convent of la Grâce-Dieu.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span></p>

<p>Opposite the entrance of the glacière, there is a little
restaurant where the peasants come to dance and picnic,
and where the few travellers who get to these parts, can
obtain a tolerable <i>déjeuner</i>. They keep a fair <i>vin du pays</i>
there, and we had some trouble on the way home in consequence.
Our driver, a talkative specimen of the genus
and an old soldier of Bourbaki&rsquo;s, told us, on the way out,
many things about Besançon during the Franco-German
war and of the retreat of the French army into Switzerland;
but on the way home, he showed that he evidently
was not a member of the blue ribbon army.
He first seemed desirous of not taking us back to Besançon,
preferring to go in the other direction towards Bale;
and afterwards he evinced a violent inclination to go to
sleep. We thought we should have to request him to
change seats with us, and drive back ourselves, but we
obviated the difficulty by plying him with questions as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
soon as he began to nod on his box. Eventually, we
reached Besançon all right, only once bumping a passing
cart, and only once nearly capsizing into a ditch. If
Americans can learn some points from Europeans about
forestry, I think the latter might get some equally valuable
information from us concerning the use of water,
externally and internally.</p>

<p>The good lady at the restaurant acts the part of the
old-fashioned cave dragon, and we had to appease her by
handing over four <i>sous</i> as a preliminary to exploration.
She also had a sign up, saying that no one is allowed to
break off or take away any ice, which must sadly interfere
with the tourists&rsquo; privilege of bringing away specimens.</p>

<p>The entrance of the glacière was surrounded by
woods, which formed a natural rampart to anything like
wind. As we stood facing the glacière a great pit opened
before us, with a slope about one hundred and thirty-five
meters long leading to the bottom. This slope is at first
gentle in its gradient, but lower down it steepens to an
angle of some thirty degrees so that we were glad to
resort to the trail which descends in regular Alpine zigzags.
In one place, on the right hand, there were the
remains of a stone wall with a door, and local tradition
relates that in former times there was a sort of fortified
habitation there, which was used in war times as a place
of retreat. The lower part of the slope is covered by a
protecting roof of rock which, thin at the rim where it is
edged with forest, gradually slopes downward overhead
so that at the mouth of the glacière we looked back and
up what might be described as an immense tunnel. The
lower part of the slope was a mixture of broken rocks,
mud and ice: the last, however, seemed to be all on
the surface, although it was impossible to determine
whether it went to any depth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span></p>

<p>At the base of the tunnel we found ourselves on the
threshold of an immense, almost circular cave, with a
diameter of some fifty meters, rising overhead into a regular
vault or dome about twenty-seven meters in height.
The entrance to the cave is so large that plenty of daylight
is admitted, and the whole cave easily examined.
The rocks are of a yellowish brown hue, and I could
not help thinking of Nibelheim in Richard Wagner&rsquo;s
Rheingold.</p>

at accuracy of measurement, and are only explanatory of the text.</p></div>

<p>The bottom of the cave was entirely covered with a
flooring of ice. How thick this flooring was there was
no means of judging, as there were no holes, but it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
have been at least two or three meters thick in places.
At the back of the cavern, directly facing the entrance,
one magnificent frozen water fall streamed from a fissure.
It was perhaps five meters high, and began
to take the fan shape from its origin. The base was
about four meters wide, and did not rest on the ice
floor, but on a sloping rock extending out from the
side of the cave.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable feature of all, were six
or seven great ice stalagmites, shaped like cones or rough
pyramids, which rose on the floor of the cave. One of
these was at least five meters in diameter and six in
height, and seemed perfectly solid. In the case of two of
the others, however, the cones were broken on one side,
revealing in each the stem and branches of a young pine
tree. These evidently had been planted in the ice and
round them the columns had grown. Whether all the
ice cones were thus artificial in their origin I could not
determine, but it seemed probable that they were the
result of years of undisturbed accretion and growth. In
both the cones where the break on the side gave a
view into the interior, the dark blue-green color of deep
glacier crevasses was present.</p>

<p>A pool of water, perhaps thirty centimeters in depth
and three or four meters in diameter, lay at one place
on the ice floor. The whole cave was damp and the
ice in places decidedly slushy, in fact all the signs showed
that it was thawing. In the case of this glacière as well
as in those of the Mont Parmelan, it seemed clear that
it must be in the winter months that the formation of
ice takes place.</p>

<p class="caption3">DÓBSINA JEGBARLANG.</p>

<p>The cavern of Dóbsina, in the Carpathian Mountains,
is easily reached either from Poprád to the north, or
from Dóbsina to the south. The hotel at Poprád is better,
however, than the inn at Dóbsina, where my brother
and I spent two nights. It was decidedly primitive. The
food was not so bad, but the pigs ran round in the courtyard,
and one morning a gypsy band woke us at half-past
three o&rsquo;clock by playing in front of our windows, in dreadful
wailing tones, which were most irritating at that hour.
At the proper time, however, Hungarian gypsy music,&mdash;despite
the fact that none of the players ever seem to
look at the leader, and that each man appears to play the
tune he likes the best,&mdash;is strangely fascinating.</p>

<p>Dóbsina itself lies in a hollow, surrounded with well-wooded
hills, the general appearance much resembling
some of the valleys of the White Mountains of New
Hampshire. My brother and I started from Dóbsina
on the morning of the 27th of July, 1895, at half-past
seven o&rsquo;clock, in a little open carriage with excellent
horses and a Hungarian driver in national costume. He
was a nice fellow, but he did not understand a word of
German. The road reminded us of some of our own
mountain roads, as it was rough, full of holes and partly
washed away by the rains. We first ascended to the
crest of the surrounding hills and then descended to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
Stracena Thal, a wild limestone valley covered with fine
forest. Two hours and a half driving landed us at the
hotel-restaurant near the cave, at which I should certainly
stop on another visit. It was half an hour&rsquo;s stroll thence,
through beautiful woods, to the cavern&rsquo;s entrance. Northwards
in the distance the Tátra Range was visible, a set
of sharp bare rock peaks, at whose base, ensconced
in pine forests, is situated the famous Hungarian summer
resort of Tátra Füred, which much resembles Bar
Harbor.</p>

<p>The entrance to the cavern is enclosed by a fence with
a gate, and here the Dóbsina people have a high tariff
and take toll from tourists. At the gate, we waited for
half an hour, until a sufficient number of persons had
arrived to form a party. This mode of visiting the cave
rather detracts from the pleasure, even though it does
away with all difficulty and makes the beauties of Dóbsina
accessible to everyone. It was also necessary to wait long
enough to cool off thoroughly before entering, on account
of the icy air of the cavern, where heavy winter clothes
are indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15f" id="Page_15f"></a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 409px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2. Vertical Section of Dóbsina.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The entrance to Dóbsina faces nearly due north. It
is small, perhaps two meters wide and three meters high,
and is perfectly sheltered from any wind. The sudden
drop in temperature at the entrance was startling; in fact
it was the most extreme change I have noticed in any cave.
Within the length of an ordinary room, say in a distance
of five meters, we passed from an extremely hot summer
morning to the chill of a mid-winter afternoon. A slight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
air current, perhaps, issued from the entrance, as we
observed a faint mist there. At the rock portal there
was ice on the rocks overhead, and underfoot was the
beginning of the huge mass of ice which almost fills the
cavern. A descent down eighteen wooden steps landed
us at the beginning of a great ice floor, in what is called
the <i>Grosser Saal</i>. It is a magnificent cave. The floor is
a sheet or rather a mass of solid ice, the surface of which
is level enough in one place to permit of skating; in other
spots it is sloping and covered with small ice hillocks.
The ice is solid throughout, without any holes or cracks.
Several fissure columns stream to the floor from cracks in
the sides. Joining the roof to the floor are numerous big
ice stalactites, which form frozen pillars and columns.
These are from eight to eleven meters in height, and some
two to three meters in average breadth and width. Nearly
translucent, they are covered with all sorts of icy ornaments
hanging about them in tufts and fringes; they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
beautiful in their shapes, as well as in their white and
blue colors. One of these columns is called the <i>Brunnen</i>,
because until about ten years ago, a small stream dribbled
continuously from the roof and cut a channel across the
ice floor; but now the stream has solidified into the pillar,
and the channel is filled up, although it can still be traced
in the ice.</p>

<p>The cavern is lighted by electricity, which has the
merit, even if it brings in an element of artificiality,
of clearly revealing one of the chief glories of
Dóbsina. This is the rime or hoar frost, which in the
shape of ice or snow crystals, covers the entire limestone
roof, and, reflecting the electric light, shines like frosted
silver. Some of these frost crystals seem to be precipitated
to the floor, and in one place I found a small
sheet of them, perhaps two meters in width each way,
which looked and felt like genuine snow. The general
color effect of all this upper cave is white, although there
is some blue in the ice, and gray and brown in the rocks
and shadows. It would not be much of a misnomer
to call Dóbsina &ldquo;the great white cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ice extended to the sides of the cave except in
two places. Here there were holes in the ice, bridged by
low rock arches. We passed through one of these and
descended by a wooden staircase some eighty steps, afterwards
returning up through the other arch by another
staircase. At the bottom we stood in a magnificent
gallery named the <i>Korridor</i>, formed by a solid wall of ice
on one side and by a wall of limestone rock on the other.
The ice wall is the lower portion of the ice floor; the rock
wall is the continuation of the roof. For the entire distance
the ice wall rises almost perpendicularly some
fifteen meters in height, while the rock wall arches overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16f" id="Page_16f"></a></span></p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span></p>

<p>The bottom of the <i>Korridor</i> was filled with blocks of
fallen limestone, through which any water drains off, and
on which there was a wooden walk, so that we circled
round the ice with the greatest ease. At one place on the
limestone wall hung a cluster of big icicles, which, from
their shape really deserved the name they bear, of the
<i>Orgel</i>. At another place a hole, some six or seven meters
deep, was hewn, in the form of a small chamber, directly
into the ice mass. This is the <i>Kapelle</i>, where we performed
our devotions by leaving our visiting cards on the
floor. Near the middle of the <i>Korridor</i> the ice mass
bulges out and extends to the limestone wall, breaking the
whole <i>Korridor</i> into two parts, the western portion about
eighty meters, and the eastern about one hundred and
twenty meters long. This necessitated cutting a tunnel
about eight meters long in the ice to get through. The
color of the <i>Korridor</i> is a darkish gray and is much more
sombre than that of the <i>Grosser Saal</i>. A remarkable
feature of the ice wall is the fact that distinct bands of
stratification are visible in the ice in many places. Why
the <i>Korridor</i> is not filled up with ice and why the ice
is perpendicular for such a distance are questions I am
unable to answer satisfactorily; but it is probable that
the temperature of the rock walls is sufficiently high to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
prevent ice from forming in winter or to melt it in
summer if it does form in winter.</p>

<p>The air in Dóbsina seemed still, and scarcely felt damp.
In one or two places in the <i>Grosser Saal</i> there was a
slight sloppiness, showing incipient signs of thaw. In
the <i>Korridor</i> it was freezing hard.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE KOLOWRATSHÖHLE.</p>

<p>The Kolowratshöhle is situated on the north slope of
the Untersberg, near Salzburg, at an altitude of 1391
meters. My brother and I visited it on the 2d of August,
1895. We had one of the patented guides of the district,
Jacob Gruber by name, in regular Tyrolese dress, with
gray <i>jacke</i> and black chamois knee breeches. We left
Salzburg in the early morning in an <i>einspänner</i> and drove
to the foot of the Untersberg in about an hour, whence,
by a rough path passing by the Rositten Alp, we ascended
to the cave in about three hours. The last hundred and
sixteen meters of the path were cut across some moderately
steep rock slabs and a perfectly unnecessary iron
hand-railing affixed.</p>

<p>The entrance faces northeast. Here there must have
been a slight draught of cold air moving outwards, the
effect of which was perceptible to the eye, as at the point
where the cold inside air met the quiet warm outside air,
a faint mist was visible. From the entrance, a sharp slope,
set at an angle of about forty degrees, led to the lowest
point of the cave. The upper half of this slope was still
covered with the winter snow which had blown or had
slid in. We descended on the right hand edge of the
snow by means of some steps cut in the rock by the
<i>Deutschen-Oesterreichischen Alpen Club</i>. These steps
were covered with a sticky, red mud, which left almost
ineradicable stains on our clothing, and as there was also
ice in places, they were decidedly slippery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span></p>

<p>At the bottom of the slope we were at the lowest
point of the cave, to which all the water flowed, and
where it drained off into a crack with a loud gurgling
noise. Back of us was the daylight streaming through
the entrance; opposite to us was first an ice floor,
then a great ice slope, which came down from the further
end of the cave. The ice was transparent and of a pale
ochre-greenish hue, and filled the entire width of the cave.
There is a streak of iron, probably, through the limestone,
which in places tints the rocks a dull red. The
color impression is a dull green-red, and, on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
of the size of the entrance, the light effect is only semi-subterranean.</p>

<p>The ice floor was covered with a layer of slabs of
ice, eight or ten centimeters thick, which, earlier in the
year, had evidently had water under them. The ice
wall or ice slope consisted of two big waves, one above
the other, the lower set at an angle of about ten
degrees, the upper set at an angle of about twenty-five
degrees. To get up the upper wave required about
twelve steps cut with the axe. Behind the upper wave,
five or six fissure columns streamed out to the beginning
of the ice. One ice stalactite, at least two or
three meters long, overhung the ice floor, and Gruber
said about this: &ldquo;Well, I wonder it has not fallen yet:
they seldom last as late in the year,&rdquo; a confirmation of
what was clearly evident, namely, that the whole cave
was in a state of thaw.</p>

<p>In two places there was a strong, continuous drip
from the roof to the ice floor, which formed, in each
case, what I can only call an ice basin. These basins
were nearly circular; one was about four meters, the
other about two, in diameter. Around about two-thirds
of the rim of the larger one, ice rose in a surrounding
ring two or three meters high, suggesting that
earlier in the year this basin was a cone, and possibly
a hollow cone. The depth in the ice floor, in both cases,
was about one and a half meters, and each basin
contained some thirty centimeters in depth of water.
They reminded me of the rock basins one sees in
mountain torrents, where an eddying current has worn
smooth all the edges of the rocks. From the larger of
these basins, a channel as deep as the basin ran to the
lowest point of the cave. This channel was cut out by
the overflow, which ran through it in a tiny stream.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

The two latter photographs are, I believe, the first good ones ever
obtained of the inside of the cave. They were taken without artificial
light on quick plates; the best of the two received an hour and a half,
the other two hours&rsquo; exposure. The photographer said at first that
it was not possible to succeed, and it was only by promising to pay
him in any case, that he could be induced to try.</p></div>

<p class="caption3">THE SCHAFLOCH.</p>

<p>The Schafloch, on the Rothhorn, near the Lake of
Thoune, is one of the biggest glacières in the Alps.
On the 15th of August, 1895, after early coffee, made
by the <i>portier</i> of the Hotel Belvedère at Interlaken, I
drove to Merligen, on the north shore of the lake, with
Emil Von Allmen, an excellent guide. We left Merligen
on foot at a quarter before seven, and, making no stops
on the way, reached the Schafloch at ten minutes past
ten. The path mounts gently up the Wüste Thal, which
higher up is called the Justiz Thal. The track through
the latter is almost on a level, over grassy alps. On the
right hand rise the steep, almost dolomitic, limestone cliffs
of the Beatenberg. On the left is the range of the
Rothhorn, with steep grass and forest slopes below, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
limestone cliffs above. The last hour of the walk was
up these slopes, by what Baedeker calls a &ldquo;giddy path.&rdquo;
By leaving the word &ldquo;giddy&rdquo; out, his description is accurate.
The cavern is at the base of the limestone cliff,
and the grass slope extends up to it.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Schafloch is at an altitude of 1752
meters: it is a fine archway, and a low wall is built partly
across it. In front of this, we sat down and consumed our
chicken and cheese, and that best of a traveller&rsquo;s drinks,
cold tea. The day was windless, and when I lighted a
cigar, to see whether there was any draught at the entrance,
the smoke rose straight up, showing that the air
was perfectly still. When we were sufficiently cooled
off, we entered the cave. The entrance faces east-south-east,
but after about ten meters the cavern takes a sharp
turn to the left, forming a sort of elbow, and runs about
due south, constantly descending in an almost straight
line. For the first eighty meters or so, the floor was
covered with blocks of fallen limestone, among which we
had to carefully pick our way. Then we began to find ice,
which, a few meters further on, spread out across the
entire width of the cave, with a gentle slope towards the
left. The surface of the ice was rather soft, and the whole
cave was evidently in a state of thaw. A few scratches
with the axe&mdash;the most invaluable friend in an ice cave&mdash;were
necessary at one place to improve our footing. It
would have been impossible to move here without a light,
and I carried our torch, made of rope dipped in pitch, which
occasionally dropped black reminders on my clothes. We
were in the middle of a great ice sheet to which several
fissure columns streamed. On the right hand a beautiful
ice stalactite flowed from the roof to the floor; it was
some five meters high, and perhaps seventy-five centimeters
in diameter, and swelled out slightly at the base.
On the left hand were three or four ice stalagmites, shaped
like pyramids or cones.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span></p>

<p>One of these cones was especially remarkable. It was
at least five meters high&mdash;Von Allmen said eight&mdash;and
at the bottom was about four meters in diameter. The
base of this cone was entirely hollow. There was a break
on one side by which we could enter, and we then stood on
a rock floor with a small ice dome or vault overhead. I
have seen no other hollow cone like this. The guide
lighted a red Bengal fire inside, when the whole pyramid
glowed with a delicate pink light, resembling <i>Alpenglühn</i>.
Near this cone stood the half of another ice cone. It was
quite perfect, and the missing half was cut off perpendicularly,
as if with a huge cleaver. A hollow in the base of
the remnant showed that this cone must have been originally
also a hollow cone, and its destruction was probably
due to the change in the temperature of the drip from
the roof, at the setting in of the summer thaw.</p>

<p>Just beyond the cones, the ice floor steepens and curls
over into a big ice slope, one of the finest I have seen.
Von Allmen spoke of this as <i>der gletscher</i>, an expression
I never heard applied elsewhere to subterranean
ice. On the right side, the slope would be difficult to
descend in the darkness. On the left, the slope is gentle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
and a rock juts out a little way down. Von Allmen
insisted on roping&mdash;an unnecessary safeguard&mdash;but he
said: &ldquo;If you slip, you will probably break an arm or
a leg, and then we shall be in a nice mess.&rdquo; He then
cut about twelve steps in the ice, down to the rock, while
I shed light on the performance with our torch. We
were so completely away from daylight that black was
the predominating color; and even the ice was a dark
gray, and only appeared white in the high lights. Below
the rock, we found a narrow strip on the left side
of the ice slope free from ice and blocked with boulders,
over which we carefully picked our way down. At
the bottom, the ice expanded into a level surface, stretching
nearly to the end of the cave. There were only a
few fissure columns in this part of the cavern, where the
most remarkable feature was the cracks in the rock
walls, which were so regular in formation that they
almost looked like man&rsquo;s handiwork. The rocks are
free from stalactites, and in fact stalactites seem a good
deal of a rarity in glacières.</p>

<p>On retracing our steps, we saw, when the first glimmers
of daylight became perceptible, the rocks assume a
brilliant blue color, as if they were flooded with moonlight.
This effect lasted until near the mouth of the
cavern.</p>

<p class="caption3">DÉMÉNYFÁLVA JEGBARLANG.</p>

<p>A little west of Poprád, in Northern Hungary, on
the railroad between Sillein and Kassa, is the village of
Liptós Szt Miklós, to which place I journeyed on the
12th of June, 1896. The conductor was the only man
on the train or at any of the stations who would admit
that there was a glacière at Déményfálva, and that it
was feasible to get into it: every one else professed
entire ignorance on the subject. It is perhaps, worth
noting at this time that it is always difficult to get any
information about glacières; in fact, the advice about
cooking a hare might well be applied to glacière hunting:
first catch your glacière.</p>

<p>The scenery between Sillein and Miklós was picturesque.
The hills were covered with forest. In one place,
the railroad ran through a beautiful mountain gorge
alongside a river, where a number of rafts were floating
down. There were also some primitive ferries, where a
rope was stretched across the river, and the force of the
current carried the ferryboat across, once it was started.
Many peasants were at work in the fields; often in
squads. White, blue, brown, and a dash of red were
the predominating colors in their dress. The men wore
white trousers, made of a kind of blanket stuff, and a
leather, heelless moccasin of nearly natural shape. Almost
all the women had bare feet; those of the older ones were
generally shaped according to Nature&rsquo;s own form, while
those of the younger ones were generally distorted from
wearing fashionable shoes. We went past several villages
of huts with thatched roofs, something like the Russian
villages one sees beyond Moscow, only less primitive.</p>

<p>The inn at Miklós was poor, and as at Dóbsina, the
pigs lived in the yard and occasionally came for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
interview under the covered doorway. Inquiries elicited
the information that Déményfálva could be reached by
carriage, so I engaged one at the livery stable. The
owner told me that about twenty years before, he leased
the glacière and carried on a regular business in supplying
Buda-Pest with ice. He had thirty lamps put in
to give light to the workmen, who brought up the ice in
baskets on their backs.</p>

<p>At half past five o&rsquo;clock next morning the carriage,
which was innocent of paint, lined with a sort of basket
work and without springs, but certainly strongly built,
stood at the door. A boy of about eighteen years of
age, who could speak German, went along as interpreter.
The morning was dismal, and, every quarter of an hour
or so, a shower of thick mist fell and gradually made
us damp and uncomfortable. After about twenty minutes
on a pretty bad road, we came to a place where
there was a fork, and the driver turned to the left, over
a track which consisted of two deep ruts through the
fields. Soon after, we heard some shouting behind us,
and a fierce-looking man, in a leather jacket and carrying
a large axe, came up and abused the driver. He
was not an agreeable person; however, presently he
simmered down and began to smile. It turned out that
he was a <i>wächter</i>, that is, a guardian of the fields, and
that we were trespassing. The driver meekly promised
to return by the other route, and we went on our way
in peace. After awhile, we drove into some woods and
then into a mountain gorge, with forest-covered slopes
at the base and with limestone cliffs jutting out above.
Here we came to the cottage of the <i>wächter</i> or <i>förster</i>
of the surrounding woods, who also acted as guide to
the cave, for the few tourists who came to see it; and
when he heard of our destination, he at once slipped
on a second ragged coat, took a woodman&rsquo;s axe and
started on foot, going much faster than the carriage.
This was not surprising, for the road resembled nothing
but the bed of a mountain brook, a mass of boulders
with ruts between them. This highway was made by
the peasants driving their carts over the plain in the
same place, and as the soil was cut away, the boulders
appeared; and over and among these we went banging
along, and we were jolted about and bumped into each
other, until every bone in my body ached.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span></p>

<p>At a quarter past seven o&rsquo;clock we came to another
house in a little glade, where the carriage stopped; and on
asking the <i>förster</i> for his name, he wrote down in my note
book, in a clear well formed hand:&mdash;Misura, Franz. From
the glade, ten minutes&rsquo; walk on a mountain path, up an
easy slope, took us to the entrance of Déményfálva. It is
about two meters wide by three quarters of a meter high.
We passed through and entered a large chamber, well
lighted from the right by another opening, which is
higher up and bigger than the entrance. The air in
this chamber was at about the same temperature as that
of the outside air, and, on our return from the nether
world, it seemed positively balmy. In the floor at the end
of the chamber, a small pit yawns open. It is perpendicular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
on three sides and set at a sharp angle on the fourth.
A wooden staircase of some two hundred steps, many of
which are sadly out of repair, leads nearly straight down
this slope to the glacière.</p>

<p>After descending about eighty steps of the staircase,
bits of ice appeared on the walls and floor and after some
thirty steps more, a lateral gallery opened to the right,
and into this we turned. This may be called the upper
cave or story, for in Démenyfálva&mdash;besides the entrance
chamber&mdash;there are practically two stories, the upper one
of which is mainly ornamented with stalactites, the lower
one with ice. There was a little ice on the floor from
which rose some small ice columns, perhaps fifty centimeters
in height. The cave or gallery had a gentle
downward slope and turned towards the left. After some
little distance, we came to another wooden staircase, of
ten or twelve steps, quite coated over with thick, solid ice.
Misura had to cut away at it for several minutes, before he
could clear the steps enough to descend. This was in
fact the beginning of an ice wall, the <i>Eiswand</i> or <i>Eismauer</i>,
which, turning to the right, flowed through a rock
arch to the lowest cave. The rock arch or portal was
some three meters wide and two meters high, and a
fringe of beautiful organ-pipe like icicles hung on it on
the right hand. Just beyond the portal the ice sloped
steeply for a couple of meters; then it became level and
on it rose a little pyramid, a meter and a half in height
perhaps, and a column; then the ice sloped away again
to the lower cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28f" id="Page_28f"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span></p>

<p>We then continued our course beyond the rock portal
along the upper cavern for about two hundred meters.
It was a fine large gallery or passage and during the
first fifty meters or so, we found numerous small ice
cones, perhaps a hundred of them, from tiny little ones
to some about forty centimeters in height. Many of
these were columnar in form, nearly as large at the top
as at the base: in some cases the top was flat, and
the columns then looked almost as if an upper portion
were sawn off. I have seen this shape of column nowhere
else. In places there were slabs and bits of ice
on the floor. The last hundred meters of this upper
cave was free from ice and was exceptionally dry. It
was formed of a pale yellow limestone rock, almost dolomitic
in color, and many stalactites, in their thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
various shapes, hung from the roof and on the sides.
In one spot, one big limestone stalagmite towered up
directly in the middle of the gallery. We did not go to
the end of the cave, where ice has never been found.</p>

<p>Retracing our course past the rock portal to the entrance
pit, we descended on the long staircase for some
eighty steps more, the amount of ice on the rocks steadily
increasing. In places, frost crystals had formed in small
quantities on the roof and walls. At the bottom of the
pit, another lateral gallery, directly under the upper
gallery, opened to the right. Entering this, we passed
over broken limestone débris, which seemed to overlie a
mass of ice. Limestone stalactites were noticeable all
through this lower cavern, and frost and icicles had sometimes
formed over them, in which case the ice stalactite
assumed the form of the limestone stalactite. Advancing
a few meters, we went by, on our right hand, an ice pyramid
of a couple of meters in height. Just beyond this, the
cave turned to the left like the upper cave, and we descended
to a level floor of transparent ice, into which we
could see some distance. At this spot, numerous icicles,
generally of inconsiderable size, hung from the roof and on
the sides of the cavern.</p>

<p>At the further end of this ice floor or ice lake we
reached an ice slope, the <i>Eiswand</i>, which flowed to the ice
floor from the upper cave in several waves. It was some
six meters wide and twenty-five meters long; and it was
not steep, perhaps fifteen degrees in the steepest portions.
On the slope some old, nearly obliterated steps were visible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
and at these Misura proceeded to cut, and with torch in
one hand and axe in the other, gradually worked his way
up, until he once more reached the level spot whence we
had looked down the ice slope. Here he stood waving his
torch, a proceeding indeed he did constantly throughout
the trip, for he seemed exceedingly proud of the beauties
of his cavern. This waving of torches, however, is exceedingly
foolish, as their smoke quickly blackens stalactite,
and in fact nothing but candles and magnesium wire
should be carried for lighting purposes underground. The
ice of the ice slope was hard, gray and opaque, quite
different from that of the ice lake. The ice floor is
formed of new ice, which is gradually refilling the place
from which Misura said the ice for Buda-Pest was taken out
twenty-five years ago. To prove this assertion, he called
my attention to the side of the lake directly opposite the
ice slope. At that spot, under the limestone rubbish over
which we came, there was an outcrop of perpendicular
opaque ice about a meter high. Misura said that the
workmen began to cut at the ice slope and that they
dug out a couple of meters in depth from the ice lake,
until they had cut back to where the vertical outcrop
was standing.</p>

<p>The explanation seemed to be in accord with the facts,
and if so, it would go to show that the ice in this cave is of
slow formation and great permanency; as seems also
proved by the steps on the ice wall, which&mdash;we were the first
party in the cave in 1896&mdash;had remained over from the preceding
summer. Misura told me he had never seen so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
ice nor seen it so hard as during our visit, and he added
that there was generally water on the ice lake, and he
thought there would be some in two or three weeks more.
The greatest quantity of ice in the upper cave was at the
head of the ice-slope, and it would seem as though there
must be cracks or fissures in the overhead rocks there,
through which the water is supplied to feed the ice, not
only that of the upper cave, but also the larger portion of
that of the lower cave.</p>

<p>The heavy winter air would naturally sink down into
the entrance pit to the lower cavern, and some of it diverge
into the beginning of the upper cavern, which at first is
distinctly a down slope. A little beyond the portal at
the head of the ice slope, the upper cave is either horizontal
or in places slightly ascending. Probably this prevents
the cold air from entering further, and probably
also, the heat of the earth neutralizes the cold air of
winter beyond a definite spot.</p>

<p>The air in the cave seemed absolutely still throughout;
it was also extremely dry, undoubtedly because melting
had not yet begun. The icicles evidently were formed by
the slow drip freezing as it descended, and there were no
perceptible cracks nor fissures in the rocks underneath
them. The facts seem to me to prove that neither
evaporation nor regelation can be the factors at work in
making the ice and we may deduce an important rule
therefrom. When a cave is dry, then the air is dry;
when a cave is wet, then the atmosphere is damp. In
other words, the state of dryness or dampness of glacière
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
atmosphere depends on how much the ice is thawing and
parting with its moisture.</p>

<p>On our return to the base of the long staircase, and
while we ascended it, we had an exquisite moonlight effect,
much resembling the one at the Schafloch.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FRAINER EISLEITHEN.</p>

<p>About two hours by rail, north of Vienna, is the village
of Schoenwald, to which I journeyed on June the
15th, 1896. At the railroad station there was a K. K.
Post Omnibus in waiting, which, when it was packed
with passengers and luggage, drove over to Frain in an
hour. The admirable road lies across a rolling plain,
until it reaches the brink of the valley of the Thaya, to
which it descends in long Alpine zigzags. On the bluff
overlooking the opposite side of the river, there is a fine
<i>schloss</i>.</p>

<p>I secured the seat next to the driver and questioned
him about the Eisleithen. Although he had driven on
this road for five years, without visiting the Eisleithen,
yet he was positive that they were warm in winter, but
cold in summer. He said more than once: <i>Desto heisser
der Sommer, desto mehr das Eis</i>, and in fact was an emphatic
exponent of the notions generally held by peasants,
which some <i>savants</i> have adopted and tried to expound.
At Frain, I applied at the little hotel for a guide, and was
entrusted to the care of the hotel boots. He was an
intelligent, talkative youth, but he insisted also that &ldquo;the
hotter the summer, the more ice there is.&rdquo; However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
he was polite, and made up for any shortcomings by
always addressing me as <i>der gnädige Herr</i>.</p>

<p>The day was hot, so it took us three-quarters of an
hour on foot, along the valley of the Thaya, to reach
the base of the bluff where the Eisleithen are situated,
at an altitude of about four hundred meters. The hillside
is covered with patches of scrubby forest; and towards
the summit, the entire mass of the hill is honey-combed
with cracks and the rocks are much broken up.
After about ten minutes&rsquo; ascent up a little path, we came
to small holes, from each of which a current of cool air
poured out; these holes seemed fairly horizontal, and
the temperatures were high enough to prove that there
was no ice within. A little further on, we came to a hole
or tiny cave among a pile of rocks, where there was
a painted sign: <i>Eisgrube</i>. It went down from the mouth,
and I put my hand well in, but, beyond the length of my
arm, I could neither see nor measure its shape or depth.
The air felt cold, but was nowhere near freezing point;
nor was it possible to determine whether there was a
draught: it may or may not be a wind cave. Not far from
this, there were two gullies, each terminating in a small
cave. The first gully was planned somewhat like certain
traps for wild animals, that is, it narrowed gradually from
the entrance, then became covered over; and then dwindled,
after some four meters more, into a small descending
hole, the end of which we could not reach. But we
got in far enough, to come to large chunks or slabs of
ice plastered about on the floor and sides. In this cave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
which was sheltered against sun and wind, the air, as tested
by the smoke of a cigar, was motionless, and the cave
seemed unconnected with any air current. The second
gully terminated in a somewhat larger cave, whose floor
was well below the entrance; no ice was visible, however,
although the air was still and the temperature low. This
cave may or may not be a glacière; but surely it is not
a cold current cave.</p>

<p>These Frainer Eisleithen certainly offer an interesting
field to anyone studying subterranean ice, from the fact
that there are, in the same rocks, caves without apparent
draughts in summer and containing ice, and caves
with distinct draughts and no ice. The problem seems
more intricate than is usually the case, but the solution
is simply that the two classes of caves happen to be
found together.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE EISHÖHLE BEI ROTH.</p>

<p>The Eifel is one of the bleakest districts of Central
Europe, and to one entering it from the vineyards and
the well-inhabited basin of the Rhine, the contrast is impressive.
The railroad rises gradually to a land of comparatively
desert appearance, with rocks and trees on the
heights and a sparse cultivation in the valleys. But, if
the country is unattractive to the agriculturist, it is interesting
to the geologist, on account of the great
number of extinct volcanoes. Almost in the centre of
the Eifel is the little town of Gerollstein, famed for the
<i>Gerollsteiner Sprudel</i>, which gives forth an effervescence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
undreamed of by anyone, who has not visited the birth
place of some of these German table waters.</p>

<p>About an hour&rsquo;s walk from Gerollstein, on the side
of a small hill, is situated the little Eishöhle bei Roth,
named after a neighboring village. I went to this place,
on the 25th of June, 1896, with a young boy as guide.
The cave is sheltered from the wind by a wood around
it, among which are many large trees. It is at the base
of a wall of piled up lava, or at least volcanic, rocks
which form a sort of cauldron. The entrance is a small
tunnel some five meters long, which goes straight down
at an angle of about twenty-five degrees and then turns
sharply to the left. At the turn, the cave may be perhaps
one meter in height. We did not go beyond this
spot, where the air was icy and the temperature sub-normal,
as the tunnel was blocked up by a large boulder,
which had evidently recently fallen from the rocks in
front. There was no ice, as far as we went, and the boy
said it began three or four meters further in. He told
me that there was no ice in the cavern in winter, but
admitted that he had not entered it at that season, so
that was hearsay. He had heard also that the ice was
sometimes taken out for sick people, but otherwise it
was not used.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the conditions at Roth show
that the ice is formed by the cold of winter alone: the
cave is well below the entrance; it is the lowest point
of the surrounding cauldron of rocks and all the cold
air naturally gravitates to it; it is sheltered by rocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
and trees from wind or exposure to the rays of the
sun; the tunnel faces nearly due north; and the water
necessary to supply the ice, easily soaks between the
lava blocks.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FRAUENMAUERHÖHLE.</p>

<p>Eisenerz, in Eastern Tyrol, is a picturesquely situated
little town. It is at the bottom of a great valley,
with mountains all around it. Two of these are bare,
gaunt limestone peaks, which are decidedly dolomitic in
form and color. The sharpest of these is to the north.
It is called the Pfaffenstein and is the beginning of the
range culminating in the Frauenmauer. On a mountain
to the east of the town, one sees the iron mines and
works, whence the town takes its name &ldquo;Ironore,&rdquo; and
whence quantities of iron are taken out every year. The
mines are said to have been in operation for over a
thousand years, since about A. D. 800. After the ore
is taken from the mine and roughly prepared, it is run
down in small cars through a covered way to the railroad
station to be shipped; and at certain times there
is a seemingly endless procession of these cars, each
bearing, besides its load of ore, a miner, with clothes
and person entirely begrimed to the yellow-brown color
of the iron.</p>

<p>As I walked out of the Eisenerz railroad station, an
old man in Tyrolese costume asked me if I wanted a
<i>träger</i> and a guide, so, while he was carrying my valise
to the hotel, we came to terms. He was one of the

patented guides of the district and wore the large badge
of the Austrian guides. If the size of the badge made
the guide, one should be safe with Tyrolese, but for
difficult excursions, it will not do to trust to a guide
simply because he happens to be &ldquo;patented&rdquo;; that is,
not if one values the safety of one&rsquo;s neck. Next morning,
July the 9th, 1896, the old guide arrived betimes at
the hotel and roused me by tapping on the wall below
my window with his stick. We left at half past five
o&rsquo;clock. My companion, who should have known better,
had not breakfasted, so by the time we reached the
Gsoll Alp at a quarter-past seven, he was almost tired
out. He wore the regulation black chamois knee breeches
and a <i>gamsbart</i> in his hat. He picked many flowers en
route, ostensibly because they were pretty; but in reality,
I think, because it gave him the opportunity to recover
his wind. He told me he was sixty-three years
old, and he certainly went up hill with some difficulty,
and for the first time in my life, I fairly succeeded in
showing a clean pair of heels to a <i>patentirter führer</i> on
a mountain side. At one place he found a large snail
in the road. This he wrapped up in leaves and placed
on a rock, and on our return he picked the leaves and
snail up, and rammed the whole bundle into his pocket,
informing me that it was excellent <i>Arznei</i>, although he
did not mention for what complaint.</p>

<p>The road led up a wooded valley, in a sort of series of
steps, bits of even ground interspersed by steeper ones,
with the Pfaffenstein-Frauenmauer limestone peaks poking
up their jagged summits on the left. The sky was clear
at starting, except in the west, where clouds were forming,
and these gradually overspread the whole sky, and
finally turned to rain. Just before we reached the Gsoll
Alp, we went by a huge snow avalanche, which had
fallen in February and torn a lane clear through the
pines, bringing down numbers of them with it. The
remains of the avalanche were banked up on the side
of the road, which was cut out, and many of the pines
were still piled on and in the snow. Stopping ten
minutes at the alp to allow my guide to recuperate on
some bread and milk, we then crossed the pastures and
pushed up a rather steep slope by a small path, at one
place crossing the remains of another avalanche. We
also came near having the attentions of a little bull which
was screaming viciously. My guide said it was an extremely
disagreeable beast, but he did not think it would
attack him, as he always made a point of giving it
bread when at the châlet. We reached the entrance of
the cave at a quarter-past eight.</p>

<p>A man and a boy from Eisenerz, who had heard I
was going to the cavern and who wished to profit by
my guide, caught up with us here. They were much
disappointed when I told them I should visit only the
<i>Eiskammer</i>. They went into the cave at the same time
that we did, and eventually we left them pushing up
one of the side chambers, with only one torch in
their possession. My guide said he thought they were
risking their lives, as there were many holes they might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
fall into, besides the probability of their finding themselves
in total darkness. He told me that once, while
in the cavern, he heard distant yells, and, going up the
gallery whence they proceeded, found a man half dead,
who said he had tried to come through the mountain
by himself, had broken his lantern and had remained in
the darkness an indefinite number of hours; a situation,
the horror of which could not be realized by anyone who
has not been underground without a light and felt the
absolute blackness of a cavern.</p>

<p>The Frauenmauer is a limestone peak, 1828 meters
in height, one of several forming a horseshoe round the
Gsoll Alp. It presents on that side a sheer wall of rock,
in which there are two holes close together, at an altitude
of 1335 meters. These are the lower openings of the
Frauenmauerhöhle, of which the higher and biggest one
is used for an entrance. They are some thirty or forty
meters from the base of the rock wall, and a flight of
wooden steps leads up to the entrance opening, which
is narrow and high. At the top of the steps, we stood
in the mouth of the cave; and, going in four or five
meters, saw the other opening to the left, below us.
About five meters further, there was one small lump of
ice, as big as a pumpkin, lying on the ground, but this
may have been carried there from within. The cavern
went nearly straight for some twenty-five meters from
the entrance, rising all the time gently. Then came a
steep little drop, of some four or five meters, in the
rock floor, and here a small wooden staircase was
placed. A gallery opened to the right and this was
the cavern proper, which leads through the mountain.
It rose considerably and contained no ice as far as we
went, which was for some distance. The walking was
bad, as the floor was covered with <i>geröll</i>, that is broken
detritus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span></p>

<p>Returning and continuing towards the freezing chamber,
the floor of the cavern began to rise once more, continuing
for some forty-five meters to its highest point,
which is lower, however, than the top of the entrance,
an important fact to notice. For, although the floor of
the cave is considerably higher, at a distance of seventy
meters within, than the level of the bottom of the entrance;
still, that highest spot is below the level of the
top of the entrance. This fact, and also the size of the
gallery, unquestionably explains why the cold air can get
in as far as it does. At this highest spot we found a
considerable mass of ice, a couple of cartloads in bulk
perhaps, which the guide said would melt away later in
the summer. This was, perhaps, the remains of a fallen
stalactite. This mass of ice is an interesting point in
connection with the Frauenmauerhöhle, for it shows that
ice in a cave sometimes forms, even if in small quantities,
above the level of the base of the entrance. There
seems no reason why it should not do so, provided
there is the necessary water supply. Such ice would,
however, suffer more, as soon as the outside air was
over freezing point, than would ice which was below the
level of the entrance. It would probably disappear early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
in the year, unless the cave were in a latitude or at an
altitude where snow remained in the open during most
of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42a" id="Page_42a"></a></span></p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5. Vertical Section of the Frauenmauerhöhle.</span></div>
</div>

<p>From this highest point, the cave turns somewhat to
the left, and the floor begins to slope downward, sinking
gradually to some six meters below the level of the entrance.
Ten meters or so from the highest point, we
began to find icicles and fissure columns, and about twenty
meters further, we reached an almost level ice floor,
stretching across the entire width of the cave&mdash;some seven
meters&mdash;and extending about fifty meters more to the end
of the cave. In several places there was much frozen
rime on the rock walls. There were also a number of
columns and icicles, though none of any special beauty.
I broke a piece off one of them, and the ice was transparent
and free from prisms, showing that this column
was probably of fairly recent origin. Letting a bit melt
in my mouth, the water tasted pure and sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42f" id="Page_42f"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span></p>

<p>In two places, there were <i>abgrunds</i>, that is, holes
in the ice. One of these was a wide, deep hole on the
left side of the cave, between the rock and the ice floor.
The other was a great hole in the ice floor itself. As
the edges of both holes sloped sharply, it was impossible
to get near enough to look into either, but I threw
in lumps of ice, and from the sound should judge that the
holes were about three meters deep. The hole in the ice
floor seemed to be cut by drip, and I think they both
carried off the drainage.</p>

<p>The ice floor was sloppy and thawing rapidly. At the
furthest point we reached, within about fifteen meters
from the end of the ice chamber, we were stopped by an
accumulation of water lying on the ice. I poked into it
with my ice axe and found it about twenty centimeters in
depth. There was a crust of ice on top in places. The
lake was cold, but I am sure the water was not freezing,
as I held my hand in it at least a minute without pain.
The guide assured me that in two weeks or so the lake
would be completely frozen, provided there was some fine,
warm weather; but, if there was rain, he said that it
would not freeze. By this statement, he unintentionally
explained, what he asserted was true, namely, that the
cave froze harder in August than in July. The explanation
of course is, that in fine, dry weather, water does
not run into the cavern, and then the lake gradually
drains off, leaving the ice floor free from water; and this
the natives interpret to mean that the water has frozen up.</p>

<p>At the edge of the lake there was a fissure in the
left hand rock wall, in which my companion assured me
that a column would shortly form. I absolutely doubt
this statement, as, if it were true, it would be contrary to
everything I have seen; still, I wish I could have returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
in August, to verify the matter. I poked my torch up
the fissure, also felt in with my hand. It was cold, and on
the rocks inside there was much hoar frost, but I could
neither see nor feel any ice mass, nor am I sure how
far the fissure extended.</p>

<p>The air was still, damp and over freezing point throughout
the <i>Eiskammer</i>, and all the signs showed that the cave
was in a state of thaw. Although the rocks are limestone
and scarcely blackened by smoke anywhere, yet as our
torches did not give much light, the color impression was
black and gray, like the Schafloch.</p>

<p>At the hotel the landlord confirmed in every particular
the story of the cave freezing hardest in August or September.
He had never been there himself, but stated
that everyone said the same thing, and that many people
had &ldquo;broken their heads&rdquo; trying to account for it. At
eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, my guide came to let me
know that the man and boy, whom we left trying to penetrate
the cave, had just turned up after making all their
relatives extremely anxious. They were nearly lost, and
had in general an extremely uncomfortable time. It is
scarcely to be wondered at that accidents occur in caves
and on mountains when people, with neither knowledge
nor proper preparation, go wandering off by themselves
into the unknown.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> On the evening of June 29th, 1897, I met at Hieflau three Viennese
tourists who had come that day through the Frauenmauer. They found
the lake on the ice floor of the <i>Eiskammer</i>, just as I had in 1896. They
said also, moreover, that they found ice and icicles or ice columns in the
main cave; unfortunately, they did not explain clearly in what part.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE MILCHHÄUSER OF SEELISBERG.</p>

<p>The summer of 1896, will long be remembered by
Alpine climbers for the pitiless rain storm, which kept coming
steadily down during the vacation months. It was in the
midst of this that I arrived at Trieb, on the Lake of Lucerne,
on the 6th of August, to see whether I could find
the windholes which were reported near Seelisberg. At
the landing place I found Herr J. M. Ziegler, the owner of
the Hotel Bellevue at Seelisberg, who promptly secured
a nice, blond bearded young fellow, a relative of his and
his <i>knecht</i>, as a guide. It was pouring when we started,
a proceeding which kept on during our entire excursion.
We tramped up a narrow road, paved with great stones
in the old Swiss fashion, and, as my guide truly said,
awfully steep for horses.</p>

<p>Half an hour from the boat landing, took us to the first
milkhouse, which belonged to Herr Ziegler. It was in a
small patch of woods, and was placed against a cliff,
where rocks had fallen down and formed a talus of broken
detritus. The side walls of the house were built out from
the cliff and roofed over, and the front wall had a doorway
closed with a wooden door. At the back the detritus or
<i>geröll</i> was built into a vertical, unplastered wall between
most of the interstices of which, cool air came forth. Several
of these interstices were fairly large holes of uncertain
depth. It was a cool day and the air currents were only
a little cooler than the temperature outside.</p>

<p>Another half an hour of uphill walking, partly on roads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
and partly over soaking meadows, took us to Seelisberg,
where we stopped at the house of the owner of the second
milkhouse, to get the key. The owner could not go with
us because he had damaged his foot, by wearing great
wooden shoes or <i>sabots</i> armed with enormous spikes, while
cutting grass on steep slopes. He was hospitable enough:
unlike his dog, who was exceedingly anxious to attack us.
The owner said&mdash;in the intervals of the dog&rsquo;s howls&mdash;that
ice formed during the winter in the rear wall of his
milkhouse and remained until about June. The milkhouse
was in a little patch of woods against a small cliff,
at the bottom of which were broken rocks. We had
some difficulty in getting in, working for at least ten
minutes at the lock, while drops of rain-water would occasionally
drip into our coat collars. Just as I had given
up hope, my companion succeeded in getting the key to
turn. There were several pans, full of milk, placed to cool,
and several barrels of potatoes; and, as at the first milkhouse,
we found that the rear wall consisted simply of
heaped up detritus built into a vertical position. Gentle
air currents flowed from several large holes and from the
cracks between the stones.</p>

<p>From here we went by a path through woods and over
meadows down to the lake, coming to the shore some distance
to the west of the steamboat landing. Everything
was soaking wet, and as we proceeded, I felt my clothes
getting wetter and my shoes absorbing water like sponges
until, when we came to an overflowing brook, wading
through seemed rather pleasant. There is one advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
of getting thoroughly wet feet in the mountains: it makes
crossing streams so much easier, as one does not delay,
but simply steps right in.</p>

<p>The lower milkhouse was on the shore of the lake, near
the house of a fisherman, whose wife opened the door for
us. There was some milk in pans and several barrels of
wine; and on a board were a number of <i>ferras</i> from the
lake; the result of two days&rsquo; catching in nets. This was
the largest of the three milkhouses; although it did not
have as many big holes in the rock wall as the others, but
only the interstices between the blocks of rock, whence
we could feel cool air flowing out. The woman said that
the ice melted away by April or May, but that in winter
the wine barrels were all covered with frost. She also said
that the air coming from the clefts in summer was colder
when the weather was warm, than when it was rainy.
Doubtless the temperature of the draughts remains the
same during the summer, but the air feels cooler to the
hand when the outside air is hot.</p>

<p>A walk of another half hour, through more soaking wet
grass, brought us back to the steamboat landing at Trieb,
where I touched my guide&rsquo;s heart with the gift of a five
franc piece, and had a talk with Herr Ziegler. He said
that there were a number of places in the neighborhood
whence cold air came forth during the summer from cracks
in the rocks: that there were also other milkhouses, notably
one at Tell&rsquo;s Platte, on the lake: and that the milkhouses
were not generally used in winter, when the doors were left
open, to allow the cold air to penetrate as much as possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
through the rocks behind. During the winter the draughts
were reversed, and poured in instead of out of the openings,
and Herr Ziegler thought that at that time the interior
of the rock cracks became chilled, and that possibly ice
formed in them which helped to chill the summer currents,
when the draughts poured out from the holes.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE GLACIÈRE DE LA GENOLLIÈRE.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 11th of August, 1896, a cool and rainy
day, I left Geneva and went by train to Nyon, where I
found at the station a little victoria, in which I drove up to
Saint-Cergues. The road lay across the plain to the base of
the slopes of the Jura, and then up these in long zigzags; it
was admirably built and on the hill slopes passed the whole
way through a beautiful thick forest, principally beeches
and birches. At Saint-Cergues, I went to the Pension
Capt, where the landlady soon found a guide in the shape
of the gendarme of the district, a right good fellow, Amy
Aimée Turrian by name. He was in uniform, with an army
revolver in a holster at his belt. We then drove about
half an hour beyond Saint-Cergues, the road rising but little,
and the thick forest giving place to a more open wood of
evergreens, with patches of pasturage. As a forest sanitarium,
Saint-Cergues seems unsurpassed in the whole of
Europe. The carriage turned up a little country road,
which soon became too rough for driving, so we proceeded
on foot for about another half hour, through pine woods
and pastures, to the glacière. Turrian enlivened the way
with an account of his life as a gendarme, of the long solitary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
six hour patrols in the woods in winter, and of how
he lay in ambush for poachers. He said he would not
take long to fire on anyone resisting arrest, as that was
<i>sérieux</i>.</p>

<p>The glacière is in the middle of a pasture, with several
pine trees overhanging it. It is surrounded by a wall,
built to prevent the cows from falling in. There are two
pits, side by side and about three meters apart: they are
some thirteen meters in depth, with a width of five or six
meters. They open into one another at the bottom; the
rock separating them, forming a natural bridge overhead.
One of the pits is vertical on all sides. The other is vertical
all around, except on the side furthest away from the
natural bridge. Here the side of the pit is in the shape,
so usual in glacières, of a steep slope. Down this slope
we descended. It was slippery and muddy, owing to the
recent heavy rains, and my ice axe proved invaluable and
probably saved me some unpleasant falls. Under the
bridge, the floor was covered with a mass of shattered
limestone debris, among which there was neither ice nor
snow; both of which my guide said he had found in
abundance the preceding June. A little limestone cavern
opened on one side below the bridge. A great, flat
limestone slab formed a natural lintel, and, lighting our
candles, we stooped down and passed under it into the
cave, which was about the size of a room and in which
we could just stand up. At the entrance and over most
of the floor there was ice, in one place thirty or forty
centimeters in depth, as I could see where a drip from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
the roof had cut a hole. There were no signs of icicles or
columns. My guide said he had never penetrated into this
chamber, which he thought, on his earlier visit, was blocked
with ice and snow. I did not see any limestone stalactites
anywhere, and I am inclined to think that the low
temperatures of glacières have a tendency to prevent
their formation.</p>

<p>After our visit, we went to the Châlet de La Genollière
close by, where there were some thirty cows and calves.
The intelligent <i>berger</i> or manager said that most of the ice
from the glacière was used for butter making during the
hot weather; and that between the inroads thus made
upon it and from other causes, the ice disappeared every
year before autumn, but that it formed afresh every winter;
pretty good evidence to show that the ice in this cave has
nothing to do with a glacial period. He also stated that
when he first entered the inner chamber in the spring
there were four ice columns there.</p>

<p>The glacière de La Genollière is a clear exemplification
of the theory that the cold of winter is the sole cause for
the ice. The whole glacière is rather small and is fairly
well protected against wind. Although snow cannot fall
directly under the rock arch, yet I should imagine it drifts
under, or after melting, runs in and refreezes. To the
inner cave snow, as snow, could hardly reach; and the
cavern is probably filled, like most cave glacières, from
frozen drip. The inner cave is, therefore, a true cave
glacière, while the outer pits and the bridge are something
between a gorge and a cave. La Genollière should,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
I think, be visited about the end of June, when the ice
formations are certainly larger and more interesting than
in August.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FRIEDRICHSTEINER OR GOTTSCHEER EISHÖHLE.</p>

<p>A little to the east of, and in about the same latitude
as Trieste, is the small town of Gottschee, now reached by
a branch railroad from Laibach. Gottschee is a German
settlement almost in the centre of the district known as the
Duchy of Krain, Austria, which is mainly inhabited in
the north by Slavonians and in the south by Croatians.
Gottschee lies directly at the western base of the Friedrichsteiner
Gebirge, one of whose peaks is the Burgernock.
On the eastern slopes of this mountain is situated the
Friedrichsteiner or Gottscheer Eishöhle, at an altitude of
about nine hundred meters.</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, 1897, I left Gottschee at half past
six o&rsquo;clock in the morning with Stefan Klenka, a nice little
man. I had asked to have him come at six o&rsquo;clock, but he
did not turn up and I had to send for him. His excuse
was, that tourists always ordered him for six o&rsquo;clock, but
when the time came, they were still in bed. He had taken
a German officer and his wife to the cave the year before,
and after keeping him waiting three hours, they started at
nine o&rsquo;clock. The result was that they did not get to the
cave until two o&rsquo;clock, and returned to Gottschee just at
nightfall.</p>

<p>We reached the cave at half past eight o&rsquo;clock. The
steep and rough path went uphill through a fine forest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
which my guide said was <i>Urwald</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, primeval forest; and
there were certainly some big trees and many fallen ones,
and much underbrush. He assured me that bears were
still plentiful in the neighborhood, and that Prince Auersperg,
who owns the shooting, does not allow them to be
killed, preferring to pay for any damage they may cause
to the peasants&rsquo; fields or for any cattle they may dine on,
rather than to have these interesting animals exterminated
from his woods. He also said that there was a two meter
snowfall in Gottschee in winter: a sufficient quantity to
account for the glacières. At one place on the road we
stopped before a small crack in the rocks, and Klenka
dropped in some small stones, which we could hear strike
two or three times a long distance below. There is surely
an unexplored cavern at this spot.</p>

<p>The Friedrichsteiner Eishöhle is a large pit cave, well
lighted by daylight. It is sheltered from any winds by
the great trees which grow all around it and even over the
rock roof. A long, steep slope leads straight into the pit
and from the top the ice floor is in full sight. On both
sides of the slope the rocks are almost sheer. Over the
bottom of the slope the rock roof projects at a great
height. The sides of the cave rise perpendicularly at
least forty meters, and in fact, the cave suggests an unfinished
tunnel set on end.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the <i>Deutschen und Oesterreichischen
Alpen Verein</i> built a wooden staircase, in a series of zigzags,
on the slope. This staircase should have been
cleared off earlier in the year, but, of course, the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
was neglected. Down these steps we descended until they
became covered with snow, and lower down with hard ice.
All this was winter&rsquo;s snow which fell directly on to the
slope and gradually melted and froze again, so this was
really a miniature glacier. It was not subterranean ice at
all. We cut down the snow, but had to stop when we came
to the ice, as it would have involved a couple of hours at
least of the hardest kind of step cutting; and this my guide
did not care to undertake, especially as he was nearly
killed on this slope the week before. He had reached,
with some tourists from Trieste, a place above that where
we stopped, when he slipped and fell down the slope, shooting
clear across the cave, where he remained until ropes
were procured, and he was dragged out. He afterwards
showed me the numerous cuts and bruises he had received
on his perilous glissade.</p>

<p>We had to stop also for another reason. I had unwisely
brought as wrap, a thick overcoat reaching to
the knees, and this was such an impediment on the icy
staircase, that I took it off, and soon began to feel
long shivers creeping down my spine. This question
of extra clothing for glacière exploration is hard to arrange.
One must guard against most trying changes of
temperature. For, on entering a big glacière, the heat
of a July day without, will, at a distance of only a few
meters, give place to the cold of a January day within,
and nothing could be better devised than a big glacière
to lay the seeds of rheumatism. It is difficult to plan a
garb suitable to meet all the varying conditions, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
dress must be cool and warm, and light enough to permit
free motion. The clothes I have found most practical
are a thin waistcoat and thick trousers, and two short
sack coats, one of them a heavy winter one. The coats
should button at the throat, and it is well to place straps
round the bottom of the trousers. Thick kid gloves
should always be worn in caves, to save cutting the hands
on rocks or ice in the darkness, and hobnails may prevent
some unpleasant slips.</p>

<p>From the point where we stopped, some ten meters
away from the ice floor, the largest portion of the cave
was visible. The finest object was a big ice curtain or
<i>vorhang</i>, as my guide called it, which, from a height of
five or six meters, flowed down from fissures to the ice
floor, and which covered the rocks on the eastern side.
Under one point of this curtain, Klenka said that there
was a deep hole in the ice. Smaller fissure columns
also streamed from the rear wall to the ice floor. The
ice floor itself was flat, of an ochre greenish tinge, and
was covered with broken ice fragments. We could not
see the western portion of the cavern, as the rocks jutted
out in a sort of corner. Klenka said that there
were several small pyramids there; a large one which
he spoke of as the <i>Altar</i>; and a small ice slope, plastered
on the side rocks.</p>

<p>The sides of the cave were of a dark gray limestone
rock, and from the top of the slope they assumed a decidedly
bluish tone, and I am inclined to think that there
was already&mdash;we were there from eight-thirty A. M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
until ten A. M.&mdash;a faint mist in the cavern. This is the
most interesting phenomenon connected with the Friedrichsteiner
Eishöhle. The cavern faces due south, and
about midday, in clear weather, the sun shines directly
into it, causing a mist or cloud to form in the cave on
warm days; a mute witness that evaporation is connected
with the melting, not with the forming, of the ice. The
air at every point seemed still.</p>

<p>On my return to Gottschee, I called on one of the
professors of the K. K. Gymnasium, and he told me
many interesting facts about the surrounding country.
Among other things he said that no traces of a glacial
period or indeed of glaciers were found in the Krain;
and as this district is particularly rich in glacières, this
fact is a strong proof against the glacial period theory.
He assured me also that many bears still existed in the
neighborhood; that one family was known to inhabit the
woods round the Friedrichsteiner Eishöhle, and that he
had often seen bear tracks on his own shooting, some
ten kilometers to the south.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE SUCHENREUTHER EISLOCH.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June, 1897, I left Gottschee at six-thirty
A. M. in an <i>einspänner</i>, and drove thirteen kilometers
southward, over a good road, albeit hilly in
places, to Mrauen, which we reached in about two hours.
The weather was exceedingly hot. I took Klenka along,
as he spoke German, and he entertained me on the drive
by telling me that there were many poisonous snakes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
the country, of which the <i>kreuzotters</i> or vipers were the
worst, and that three or four persons were bitten every
year.</p>

<p>Mrauen is in Croatia, and I could see a slight difference
in the people and their dress from those of Gottschee.
From Mrauen, the landlord of the <i>Gasthaus Post</i>,
Josef Sirar, led us to the Grosses Eisloch. This is
sometimes spoken of as the Eisloch bei Skrill, but as it
lies in a patch of woods below the village of Suchenreuth,
the Suchenreuther Eisloch seems the correct name. At
least that was what Sirar called it. It took us about an
hour on foot from Mrauen to get into the woods. On
the way we met two guards in uniform, carrying Männlicher
carbines with fixed bayonets, and it was agreeable
to feel that the strong arm of the Austrian government
extended over this semi-wild land. In the woods,
following Sirar&rsquo;s able guidance, we took a short cut&mdash;always
a mistake&mdash;and were lost temporarily in a maze
of bushes and brambles, in which I thought of the <i>kreuzotters</i>.
After that, Sirar at first could not find the cave
and had to hunt around for it, while I sat on a stone and
waited impatiently.</p>

<p>At the cave a rather steep slope of wet mud, covered
with dead leaves, led down through a rock arch.
Sirar had to cut several steps in the mud with his
hatchet, or we should probably have sat down suddenly.
The archway opened into a moderately large cavern,
which was about twenty meters deep, almost round and
some fifteen meters in diameter. The slope continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
right across the cave, and on some parts of it were logs
of wood and much débris. On the wall hung a few
limestone stalactites. In the roof of the cave was a
great hole, and under this was a big cone of old winter
snow, which had become icy in its consistency, and on
which there was much dirt and many leaves. The temperature
in the cave was several degrees above freezing
point, and there was no ice hanging anywhere. Sirar
said that when the weather got hotter, the ice would come;
but as he said also, that he had been only once before
in the cave, some ten years ago, his opinion was not
worth much. Both men said that the preceding winter
was unusually warm.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE NIXLOCH.</p>

<p>Near Hallthurm in Bavaria, a railroad station between
Reichenhall and Berchtesgaden, is a well known congeries
of windholes, called the Nixloch. I visited it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
on Friday, July the 2d, 1897, with a railroad employee,
whom I found at the peasants&rsquo; <i>gasthaus</i>.</p>

<p>The Nixloch is ten minutes distant in the forest, on
the slopes of the Untersberg. It is among a mass of
big limestone blocks, and close by are the remains of
the walls of an old castle or fortification. The Nixloch
descends from the entrance for about two meters nearly
sheer, and there is just room to get through. As I sat
within the outside edge of the mouth of the cave, the
smoke of my cigar was slowly carried downward into it.</p>

<p>Dropping down through the hole, we found ourselves
in a small cavern formed of rough limestone blocks overhead
and underfoot. It is possible to go still further
down and my companion said that formerly it was possible
to go through the cave and come out at a lower
opening; this exit, however, was destroyed when the
railroad was built. The draught, as tested by the flame
of a candle, was still drawing in some seven or eight
meters from the entrance. There is a second cavity
immediately next to the entrance, and at the bottom
of these holes, the inward draught was so violent as to
blow the candle out. The thermometer outside in the
shade was 28&deg;C.; inside the cave, where the draught
was still perceptible, it was about 20&deg;C. Within the
cave I noticed two large, dark brown spiders.</p>

<p>On returning to the <i>gasthaus</i>, I had a talk with some
peasants who were dining there, and they told me that
it was warm in winter in the Nixloch, and that ice never
formed there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">THE DORNBURG.</p>

<p>If one draws a line northeast from Coblentz and
another northwest from Frankfort-on-the-Main, they will
intersect nearly at the Dornburg. The railroad from
Frankfort goes, via Limburg and Hadamar, to Frickhofen
and Wilsenroth, from either of which villages the ice
formations of the Dornburg are easily reached on foot
in half an hour.</p>

<p>I arrived at Wilsenroth on the 26th of July, 1897,
and soon found an old forester, who said he had lived
in the neighborhood for over fifty years, to show me the
way. The Dornburg is a low hill, perhaps a hundred
meters high and a kilometer long. It is basaltic and
covered with sparse woods. The forester said that on
top were the remains of the foundations of an old castle,
and that this was possibly the origin of the name Dornburg.
We circled round the eastern base of the hill for
some ten minutes, when we came to a little depression,
filled with basalt debris, among which were several small
holes, out of which came currents of cool air.</p>

<p>Ten minutes further in the woods, we arrived at the
<i>Dornburg Restauration</i> and then almost immediately at
the glacière. It is at the bottom of a talus of broken basaltic
rocks and has been much affected by the agency of
man. In it are two <i>eislöcher</i> or <i>stollen</i>, as the forester
called them. These are little artificial pits or cellars, dug
into the talus. They are side by side, opening about
southeast, and each is about one and a half meters wide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
three meters long, and two meters high. The sides are
built up with wooden posts and overhead is a thick roof
of logs strewn with dirt. The day was cool and at the
mouth of each <i>eisloch</i>, a faint outward current of air was
discernible at nine-thirty A. M. I could not find any currents
coming into the <i>eislöcher</i>. Inside it was cold and
damp, and evidently thawing. There was a good heap of
ice in each <i>eisloch</i>; it was clear, and I could detect no trace
of prisms.</p>

<p>By much questioning, I dug out something of the history
of these <i>stollen</i> from the forester. Formerly the ice
was found at this spot, among the boulders at the base of
the slope. But the people gradually took many of these
basaltic blocks away, to break up for road making, and
then the ice diminished. About 1870, a brewery, since
burnt, was built at the Dornburg and the brewer had
these <i>stollen</i> built, a sort of semi-natural, semi-artificial ice
house. Every winter, the present owner of the <i>stollen</i>
throws a quantity of snow into them, and this helps materially
in forming the mass of ice.</p>

<p>Just below the restaurant there is a spring, which was
said to be extremely cold, but there was nothing icy nor
apparently unusual about it.</p>

<p>Under the restaurant itself is an interesting cellar. It
was closed by wooden doors. First there was a passage
way which turned steadily to the right, and which we descended
by some ten steps. This was about two meters
wide and was full of beer bottles and vegetables. On
the left of the passage was a large double chamber where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
meat is kept. At eleven-thirty A. M. a faint draught blew
down the passage and into the hall, the outside door being
then open. The double hall was perhaps six meters each
way, and I could detect no air currents coming into it at
any place, except from the passage way. Both passage
and halls were, as far as I could see, entirely built over
with masonry. There was no ice and the temperature
was some 7&deg; or 8&deg; above freezing point.</p>

<p>The daughter of the proprietor of the restaurant said
that ice began to form in the cellar in February and that
it lasted generally until October; but that this year it
was destroyed early because the masonry was repaired,
although it was still possible to skate in the cellar as late
as March. In the beginning of winter the cellar was warm,
and as she expressed it, <i>der Keller schwitzt dann</i>, which
I suppose means that the walls are damp. She also
said that it was a <i>naturlicher Keller</i>, and I am inclined
to think that it was a natural glacière, converted into a
cellar.</p>

<p>This visit to the Dornburg gave me many new ideas
about classifying glacières, especially in relation to the
movements of air. I was long puzzled by the German
terms, <i>Eishöhlen</i> and <i>Windröhren</i>; and it suddenly struck
me, at the Dornburg, that this terminology is incorrect,
when used as a classification of glacières. The presence
or absence of strong, apparent draughts, cannot be considered
as a test as to whether a place is or is not a
glacière; the presence of ice, for at least part of the
year, alone makes a glacière, and this it does whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
there are or are not draughts. It seems to me more
than ever clear, however, that it all depends on the
movements of air, as to whether ice forms in a cave. If
the movements of air take the cold air of winter into a
cave, then and then only&mdash;provided there is also a water
supply&mdash;do we have ice. I am now inclined to think
that caves, as far as their temperatures are concerned,
should be classified into caves containing ice, cold caves,
ordinary normal caves, and hot caves, without reference
to the movements of air.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE GLACIÈRE DE SAINT-GEORGES.</p>

<p>From Rolle, on the north shore of the Lake of
Geneva; an excellent carriage road leads in two hours
and a half to Saint-Georges in the Jura. At first the way
goes steeply uphill and passes through many vineyards,
and afterwards it crosses level fields to Gimel, then rises
through woods to Saint-Georges. On arriving there on
the afternoon of August 3d, 1897, I found the street
filled with evergreens, and long benches and tables; the
débris of a <i>fête de tir</i>, which had lasted for two days,
with dancing and banquets and, I suspect, much <i>vin du
pays</i>.</p>

<p>When I got down stairs at six o&rsquo;clock next morning,
all the people of the inn were sound asleep recovering
from the effects of the <i>fête</i>, and instead of their calling
me, I had to call them. Finally I succeeded in getting
breakfast and then started in company with a first rate
fellow, named Aymon Émery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62f" id="Page_62f"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span></p>

<p>We walked up through woods, in about an hour and a
half, to the Glacière de Saint-Georges, which lies at an
altitude of 1287 meters in the midst of the forest. There
are two holes close together. One of these descends
vertically and is partly roofed over with logs on which is
rigged a pulley. Émery, who was the <i>entrepreneur</i> of the
glacière, which means that he attended to getting out the
ice, told me that they pulled the ice up through this
vertical hole, making a noose with a rope round each
block.</p>

<p>The other and shallower opening ended in a rock
floor, which was reached by a short ladder. To the right
was an arch, under which the rock terminated as a floor
and descended vertically, forming the wall of the cave.
On this wall two ladders, spliced at the end into one
long ladder, were placed in a nearly vertical position. I
tied the end of my rope round my waist, and got a workman,
who had come to cut ice, to pay out the rope to me,
while I went down.</p>

<p>The cave is rather long and narrow, perhaps twenty-five
meters by twelve meters, and the limestone roof
forms an arched descending curve overhead. I could not
see any limestone stalactites; neither were there any ice
stalactites or stalagmites in the cave, but a good part of
the wall, against which the long ladder was placed, was
covered by an ice curtain. It was thin and had evidently
been damaged by the ice cutters or I think it would have
covered the entire lower portion of the wall.</p>

<p>The base of the long ladder rested on an ice floor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
which filled the bottom of the cave, and which would
probably have been level if it had not been cut out here
and there in places, leaving many holes. A good many
broken ice fragments lay on the floor and in some of
the holes were pools of water. Some of the floor ice
was exceedingly prismatic in character, and I was able to
flake it off or break it easily with my hands into prisms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64f" id="Page_64f"></a></span></p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7. Vertical Section of the Glacière de Saint-Georges.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Under the vertical shaft, which is at one end of the
cave, was a mass of winter&rsquo;s snow which had fallen
through the opening. Under this snow was a deep hole,
which I believe was the drain hole of the glacière before
the ice floor was cut away to a level below its mouth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
Into this hole I threw lumps of ice and heard them go
bumping down for three or four seconds.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was not uncomfortable, although the
temperature was about 7&deg; C. The air did not feel damp,
and seemed almost still, but standing on the ice floor
nearly under the vertical hole, I found that the smoke
from my cigar ascended rapidly, and it seemed as if
there were a rising air current, which sucked up the
smoke.</p>

<p>Saint-Georges is a fine cavern and well worth visiting.
Émery said that the ice was not cut out for eight years
preceding the summer of 1897, and that for several years
it was not possible to go down at all, as there were no
ladders, until he put in the two we utilized.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> All the
natives of Saint-Georges believed that the ice was a
summer formation and that it was warm in the cave in
winter.</p>

to the left is the vertical pit, through which the ice is taken out: underneath
it, is the heap of winter snow. The man in the upper part of
the picture is standing on the rock shelf at the base of the upper
ladder and at the top of the lower ladder. To the right of the lower
ladder near the bottom, a bit of the ice curtain is visible.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">THE GLACIÈRE DU PRÉ DE SAINT-LIVRES.</p>

<p>From the Glacière de Saint-Georges, Émery and I
pushed on through the woods to the Pré de Saint-Livres.
In several places we came on the tracks of deer, and my
guide told me he had killed eleven roe during the last
hunting season. He said also that an attempt is being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
made to introduce the red deer into the Jura, and that
the experiment seemed to be meeting with success. We
kept to the crest of the ridge along wood paths, and, as
the day was fortunately cool and cloudy, we were able to
walk fast and reached the Pré de Saint-Livres in two
hours. At a spot called La Foiraudaz we met the workmen
coming down with a cartload of ice, which they
were taking to Bière. Some of this ice was extremely
prismatic.</p>

<p>The Pré de Saint-Livres is a big mountain pasture or
meadow, surrounded with hills covered with pine trees.
In the middle of it is the Châlet de Saint-Livres, round
which numerous cows and calves were congregated and
where a small shepherd gave us some milk. The châlet
is not one of the old picturesque Swiss châlets with great
stones on the roof to keep it from being blown away by
the wind, but a strongly built single storied stone
structure, which looks extremely modern among the green
hills.</p>

<p>The glacière lies close to the châlet, on the southern
side of the meadows, just on the edge of the woods, and
is surrounded with trees. It is at an altitude of 1362
meters and faces nearly due north. To prevent the cattle
from falling in, it is enclosed with a stone wall, except in
front, where there is a fence formed of an abattis of
pine trees. The cave belongs to the pit variety, and the
pit is a big one. As you stand at the top, you can look
down to the end of the glacière. The rocks are vertical
all round the pit, and in front there is a small rock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
shelf, one-third of the way down, which divides the rock
wall into two long drops. Against each of these was a
rickety ladder, so we fixed the end of my rope to the pine
trees of the fence, and hung on to it while we climbed
down. The base of the lower and longer ladder rested
on a mass of snow. This was the beginning of a long
snow slope which gradually turned to ice and filled the
cave. The cave itself, measuring along the snow slope,
is some forty meters long and some ten to fifteen meters
wide, and is entirely lighted by daylight.</p>

<p>The snow and ice slope fell in a series of small waves,
and the upper portion was rather dirty. On the right
hand the workmen had fixed a rope as a handrail, and all
the way down had cut a staircase in the ice, so that the
descent was not difficult. Some of the ice was sloppy.
The ice mass did not abut entirely against the end of the
cave, but left an open space between the ice and the rock,
some three or four meters wide and some four or five
meters deep. Here the workmen had been getting their
ice, and had cut into the ice mass for several meters,
forming a little tunnel.</p>

<p>There were no ice cones nor stalactites, neither did I
see any limestone stalactites. Much of the ice was prismatic;
in fact, together with that at Saint-Georges, it
was the most strongly prismatic I have seen. I can perhaps
best describe it, by saying that it was brittle in
texture, as I could break up small lumps in my hands.
There was more prismatic ice at Saint-Livres, however,
than at Saint-Georges. The air in the cave was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
and decidedly damp; and the temperature was several
degrees above freezing point. The day, however, was
almost windless, and I would not assert that movements
of air, due to the wind, might not sometimes take place
in the pit.</p>

<p>The Glacière du Pré de Saint-Livres is one of those
caves which may be looked on as a transitional form
between gorges containing ice and caves containing ice.
The winter snow falls into the mouth of the pit, and
is the chief foundation of the ice mass. It would be
interesting to make a series of observations in this cave
to see whether there was anything like glacier motion.
Émery, of his own accord, expressed the opinion that
much of the ice here was due to the winter snows; in
fact, he thought that it was all due to it, and that it
gradually descended into the cave and turned, little by
little, into ice. He told me that some years ago a cow
was found by the workmen, frozen into the ice, at a depth
of four meters; the flesh was perfectly preserved, and was
eaten. I asked him if he had ever seen insects in either
cave, and he said he had not.</p>

<p>From the glacière we walked back to the village
of Saint-Georges. On asking my guide how much I
owed him, he said he received four francs for a <i>journée</i>,
so I gave him six francs, and we parted the best of friends.</p>


<p class="caption3">GLACIER ICE CAVE IN THE FEE GLACIER.</p>

<p>During a rather protracted stay at Saas-Fee in Switzerland,
I visited the glacier ice cave of the Fee Glacier on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
the 15th and 16th of August, 1897, both cool and rainy
days. It is about half an hour&rsquo;s walk from the hotel to
the ice cave, which is in the snout of the Fee glacier,
below the Eggfluh. A considerable stream issued from
the cave. On nearing the opening, a strong cold air
current poured out above the stream. At the front edge
of the ice, the height of the ice roof in the centre was
perhaps twelve meters and the width fifteen meters.
Around the edge, the roof formed an almost perfect
curve. The ice walls contracted in a regular manner
within, and the cave became narrower and lower, and
suggested an enormous funnel cut in half, into which
you looked from the larger end. The cave also grew
gradually darker, and the darkness prevented seeing
further than to a depth of some fifteen meters. In the ice
walls, just inside the entrance, were several crevasses, of
the ordinary blue-green color. They followed nearly the
same curve as the roof, but did not go through to the
outside. There were no icicles. The ice was faintly
stratified in places, and at the outer edge was brittle. It
did not break into the long narrow prisms of the ice at
Saint-Georges and the Pré de Saint-Livres, but rather into
small lumps with facets, of all sorts of shapes. It was
evidently unsafe to penetrate under the ice roof, for while
I stood in front of the cave, a large lump broke off from
the roof and fell with a clatter among a lot of other ice
fragments already on the moraine floor. In two places
there was a steady rain of drops from the roof, showing
that the ice was melting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span></p>

<p>This is perhaps the glacier cave in Switzerland which
is easiest to visit, and my inspection intensified my belief
in what I consider the correct explanation of some of
the phenomena in glacières. The suggestion was that as
soon as the temperature gets above freezing point in a
glacier ice cave, the only process is that of destruction of
the ice, which seems to be also the case with glacières.</p>


<p class="caption3">LA GRAND CAVE DE MONTARQUIS.</p>

<p>My brother and I left Cluses, in Savoie, a railroad
station on the line between Geneva and Chamonix, at
two o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the 22d of August,
1897, and drove up in two hours and a half to
Pralong du Reposoir, a distance of eleven kilometers.
The road is a <i>route nationale</i>, fine and broad, with parapets
in many places. After passing Scionzier, it mounts
gradually, passing through a tremendous wild gorge, cut
by the waters and heavily clad with firs. We reached
Pralong at four-thirty, and stopped at a primitive inn, still
in process of construction, and tenanted only by blue-bloused
peasants, who, as it was Sunday night, sat up
late, drinking and making a heathenish noise they mistook
for singing. I talked to some of these men, and they all
insisted that there was no ice at the Grand Cave in
winter, but that it came in summer. <i>Plus il fait chaud,
plus ça gêle</i>, they said. One man explained the formation
of the ice in an original way, and with an intelligence
far above that of the average peasant. He considered
that it was due to air currents, and thought that in winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
the snow stopped up the holes in the rocks, through which
the currents came; but that when the snow melted, the
draughts could work, and that then they formed the ice.</p>

<p>The weather was abominable next morning, the clouds
lying along and dripping into the valley; but the inn was
so awful that we decided to try to reach the cave. We had
a nice little blue-bloused peasant for a guide, Sylvain Jean
Cotterlaz by name. We went first for about an hour on
foot towards Le Grand Bornant on a fair road, to an alp
called La Salle. This was surrounded by a herd of cows,
some of whom seemed interested in our party. It now
began to rain fiercely, and except for my brother&rsquo;s perseverance,
I should certainly have given in. A fair path led
up steep grass slopes into the clouds covering the Mont
Bargy. Each of us had his umbrella raised, and the ascent
was slippery and uninspiring. An hour took us to two
deserted huts, the Alpe Montarquis, and half an hour
beyond, we came to the caves; by which time we were
thoroughly soaked.</p>

<p>The caves are on Mont Bargy, at the base of a limestone
precipice, which, I think, faces nearly north. There
are three caves close together. The lowest, or Petite
Cave de Montarquis, Cotterlaz said is also called La Cave
des Faux-Monayeurs; as according to a, probably untrue,
tradition, it was once used by counterfeiters. Above this
is a small rock pocket, accessible down an easy slope.
We went in and found that there was no ice and indeed
scarcely any water in it.</p>

<p>The Grand&mdash;not Grande&mdash;Cave is a little higher up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
and as we came to it, several sheep, which had taken
refuge in the mouth from the storm, hastily skipped away,
evidently distrusting our intentions. The altitude of the
cave is said to be 2078 meters. The entrance must face
about north east; it is elliptical in shape, about fifteen
meters wide, and six meters high, and is badly sheltered
against the wind. The cave is of moderate size, about
sixty meters in length and forty-five meters in width, and
the average height of the roof is not over four or five
meters. A gentle slope leads downwards. Many blocks
of rock in the front part had bits of moss growing on
them, and some of the mud there was of a dull purple
color, as if some dark madder was mixed with it. There
was a red streak in the right hand wall, probably caused
by iron. I observed no limestone stalactites nor stalagmites
in the cave, the main body of which was well
lighted throughout by daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72f" id="Page_72f"></a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 426px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8. Vertical Section of Grand Cave de Montarquis.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The ice was in the shape of a nearly level floor, about
twelve meters long and eight meters wide: the shape
was irregular, and the ice so smooth that it was hard
to stand up. The rocks in the rear overhung the ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
floor at one spot; and here, there streamed from a fissure
to the ice floor an ice column, some three meters
high, whose base was fully two meters distant from the
rock wall. Near this column was a tiny ice cone, which
evidently had been bigger. Cotterlaz seemed impressed
with the fact that there was only one column in the
cave, as he said that in June, there would have been
many columns and a larger and deeper ice floor. The
ice was sloppy in places, with several small hollows cut by
the drip and containing water. In one place there was
a tiny runnel filled with water, but there was no current.
There was a good deal of drip all through the cave, and
in fact in one or two places we might have kept on holding
up our umbrellas with advantage. I hacked at several
pieces of ice, but none of it was prismatic.</p>

<p>At the rear of the cave, the ice ran, in a tongue, up
the entrance of an ascending fissure in the rocks. My
brother cut here six or seven steps in the ice; and he
found them difficult to make, as the ice was hard and thin,
and not in a melting state. Above the ice tongue we
clambered up the rocks of the fissure some four or five
meters further, finding there some lumps of ice which were
not melting. At this spot we were almost in darkness. A
lighted match burned steadily, so that there was evidently
not much draught, but the smoke gradually descended,
showing a slight downward current. This was the coldest,
as well as the furthest point of the cave we could reach,
and we there heard a tiny waterfall trickling within the
fissure, although we could not see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span></p>

<p>By this time we were all chilled to the bone, so,
abandoning the idea of entering the Petite Cave, we retreated
down the sopping wet, slippery grass slopes to
Pralong, and then immediately walked all the way to
Cluses to avoid taking cold. The Grand Cave was the
most fatiguing trip I ever made after glacières, but the
circumstances were rather unusual.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FREEZING WELL OF OWEGO.</p>

<p>On Thursday, June 23d, 1898, I went to Owego, in
Tioga County, New York. Inquiries at the Lehigh
Valley railroad station and at the chief hotel failed to
elicit any information about a freezing well; and in fact,
I soon found that the existence of such a thing was a
blank to the rising generation. So I called on an old
resident of Owego, who told me that he knew of the
well in question and that it was filled up with stones
many years ago; but that he remembered that, when he
was a boy, it used to freeze, and that it was spoken of as
the deep well or freezing well. I then walked up to the
site of the well, which is about one and a half kilometers
to the northwest from the centre of Owego and about one
kilometer from the Susquehanna River. It is directly in
the middle of the highway, and nothing is now visible but
a heap of stones.</p>

<p>Near by was the house of a Mr. Preston, who told me
he was born in 1816, and had lived all his life at this spot.
He said that the well was about twenty-eight meters deep,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
and that it went first through a layer of sand and then
through a layer of gravel. He had more than once been
down the well and had seen the sides covered with ice.
A bucket sent down for water would sometimes come up
with ice on the sides. Whether the water at the bottom
ever froze, no one knew, for the ice caked and filled up
the bore at about two-thirds of the way down and became
so thick, that as Mr. Preston put it, &ldquo;it was just like
hammering on an anvil to try to break it.&rdquo; He also
stated that another well was dug about one hundred
meters further down the road, and that originally this
sometimes had a little ice on the sides. Of late years
however, it was covered over with a wooden top and since
then no ice was known to form. I could obtain no information
about any other wells in the neighborhood
ever showing similar peculiarities.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE ICY GLEN, NEAR STOCKBRIDGE.</p>

<p>The Icy Glen is situated on Bear Mountain, about
one kilometer from Stockbridge, Massachusetts. It is in
the midst of fine woods and there are many big trees in
it. The bottom of the glen is full of rocks and boulders,
among which there is a rough path. I was told that ice
remained over there much longer than anywhere else in
the neighborhood, sometimes as late as May. On the 3d
of July, 1898, I not only found no traces of ice or snow,
but the temperatures under the boulders showed nothing
abnormal. To make up for this, however, there were
legions of mosquitoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING MARBLE CAVE, NEAR MANCHESTER.</p>

<p>Near Manchester, Vermont, there is a little cave,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
which is noteworthy, in that it is in a marble formation. It
is known as Skinner&rsquo;s Cave, because it was owned for
many years by Mr. Mark Skinner. It lies in Skinner&rsquo;s
Hollow, some five or six kilometers from the centre of
Manchester, at the base of the eastern slope of Mount
Equinox, of the Taghconic Range of the Green Mountains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> My attention was called to this cave, by Messrs. John Ritchie, Jr.,
of Boston, and Byerly Hart of Philadelphia, who visited it some years
ago. Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s opinion is that it is simply a refrigerator.</p></div>

<p>The cave is on the property of Mr. N. M. Canfield,
who, on learning the object of my visit, on the 5th of
July, 1898, with true native American courtesy, walked
up to it with me. The last two kilometers were over a
rough logging road, which towards the end was steep
and covered with many broken logs. I could not have
found the cave alone, as it was so surrounded with
bushes, that the entrance was invisible until we actually
reached it. It is in a gorge of Mount Equinox, in the
midst of a beautiful forest, which effectually cuts off any
wind. The cave faces nearly north and can scarcely
ever, if indeed at any time, be reached by the rays of the
sun. The moment we got into the entrance, we found
the chilly, damp, summer atmosphere of true glacière
caves. The rocks were brown and mossy on the outside,
but Mr. Canfield called my attention to the fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
they were marble, and on his knocking off a small piece,
a section of pure white marble was exposed. In no other
instance have I heard of a marble cave in connection
with ice. There were scarcely any cracks or crevices
in the rock.</p>

<p>The cave goes down with a steep slope from the
entrance, much in the shape of a tunnel, for some ten
meters. The slope was covered with slippery mud and
decayed leaves, and at the bottom expanded into a little
chamber, in which lay a mass of wet, compact snow, some
two by three meters. It was evident that the snow was
simply drifted in during the winter, and was in too large
a mass and too well protected to melt easily, and there
could be no question but that this place was purely a
refrigerator. The air was tranquil throughout and there
were no draughts. On the same day, a good breeze was
blowing in the Manchester Valley.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FREEZING WELL OF BRANDON.</p>

<p>The Freezing Well of Brandon is situated on the
western or southwestern outskirts of the village of
Brandon, Vermont, not far from the railroad station. I
visited it on the 7th of July, 1898. The well was protected
by a wooden cover. On raising this, a faint stream
of cool air seemed to issue forth; but this was probably
only imagination. The sides, as far down as one could
see, were built in with rather large blocks of stone without
cement. At the bottom water was visible and there
were no signs of ice. We drew up some water in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
bucket, and although it was cool there was nothing icy
about it. I twice lowered a thermometer nearly to the
water and each time after ten minutes it registered only
13&deg; C. There was certainly nothing abnormal in this
temperature, in fact it was strictly normal and my thermometer
showed conclusively by its actions that it could
not have been near any ice mass. The people at the
house, however, assured me that a month before there
was ice in the well.</p>

<p>Afterwards I called on Mr. C. O. Luce, the owner of
the well. He stated that it was eleven and a half meters
deep to the bottom, that it was dug in 1858, and that the
ground through which it goes was found frozen at a depth
of about four and a half meters. Here there is a stratum
of gravel and this is where the freezing occurs. Mr.
Luce thought that the water was under the ice, that is,
that the water came up from the bottom. He said also
that the well usually froze solid in winter; but, that as
this winter was an open one, there was less ice this year
than usual. He thought that there was less ice anyway
now than in former years, partly because of the cover
which was put over the well, and which keeps out some
of the cold; and partly because a neighboring gravel
hillock, called the Hogback, was a good deal cut away,
and this in some way affects the supply of cold in the
gravel. He added that the sandy soil round Brandon
does not as a rule freeze to a greater depth than two
meters each winter. The house built beside the well was
said to be comfortable in winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span></p>

<p>There seems no doubt that this is another refrigerator.
The cold water of the winter snows percolates into the
gravel mass and refreezes, and, owing to the bad conductive
quality of the material, the gravel remains frozen later
than the soil elsewhere in the neighborhood. The fact that
the well went through a frozen gravel stratum when dug,
proves that it is not alone the air that sinks into the well
itself, which makes the ice. The fact that the well freezes
on the whole less than formerly, apparently partly owing
to the digging up of some of the gravel close by, goes to
prove the same thing. The fact that the well generally
freezes solid every winter, shows that although some of
the gravel mass possibly remains frozen all the time,
much of the ice is renewed each year. This is especially
important as proving that the ice found in gravel deposits
is due to the cold of winter and not to a glacial period,
although, of course, no one could say for how long a time
the ice was forming and melting; and this process might
date back to the time of the formation of the gravel mass.</p>

<p>I could learn nothing of any similar place near Brandon,
except that Mr. Luce said that in an old abandoned
silver mine in the neighborhood, he had once seen ice
during hot weather.</p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING TALUS ON LOWER AUSABLE POND.</p>

<p>On the eastern side of Lower Ausable Pond, Essex
County, New York, at the foot of Mount Sébille or Colvin,
there is a talus of great Laurentian boulders, which
fell from the mountain and lie piled up on the edge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
lake. Among these boulders, at a distance of about five
hundred meters from the southern end of the lake, there
are spaces, several of which might be called caves,
although they are really hollows between the boulders.
On the 12th of July, 1898, I visited this spot with Mr.
Edward I. H. Howell of Philadelphia. From several of
the rock cracks we found a draught of air flowing strongly
out, as tested by the smoke of a cigar. The air was
distinctly icy and there could be no question that there
was a considerable quantity of ice among the rocks to
produce the temperature.</p>

<p>In three places we found masses of ice. One of these
hollows was small, and the other two were much larger.
One of the latter was almost round in shape, and perhaps
three meters in diameter; with a little snow near
the mouth and with plenty of ice at the bottom. The
other was a long descending crack between two boulders
which joined overhead, and with the bottom filled by a
long, narrow slope of ice, perhaps seventy-five centimeters
in width and six meters in length, set at an angle of
about thirty-five degrees. The ice was hard and non-prismatic.</p>

<p>The cold air affects a large area of land around the
boulders. Mr. Howell called my attention to the flowers
of the bunch-berry, which he said were at least two weeks
behind those on the surrounding mountains. The same
was true of <i>oxalis</i>, a pretty white flower, of which we found
several beds in full bloom.</p>

<p>Mr. Howell went to this talus, on the 4th of July
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
previous, with Mr. Niles, President of the Appalachian
Mountain Club, on which occasion they found plenty of
snow near the entrance of the larger hollow. Mr. Howell,
indeed, has repeatedly visited this place, and always found
ice, which must, therefore, be looked on as perennial.
At all times also he has felt cold draughts flowing out;
sometimes they were so strong as to lower the temperature
over the lake to a distance of thirty meters or
more: on hot days he has seen occasionally a misty cloud
form on the lake in front of the boulders. Mr. Howell
considers that the draughts so affect the surrounding air,
that an artificial climate is produced, and it is owing to
this that spring flowers bloom late in July and sometimes
in August. Another fact well known to him, is that in hot
weather, the spot in front of the boulders is the best in the
whole lake to catch trout, as they always congregate in the
coldest water. The Adirondack guides use these ice retaining
hollows, which they call ice-caves, as refrigerators for
their provisions and game in hot weather: they say that
the ice is formed in winter and remains over during the
summer, as it is so well sheltered.</p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING TALUS OF THE GIANT OF THE VALLEY.</p>

<p>On the indications of Mr. Otis, chief guide of the Adirondack
Reserve, I explored with Mr. C. Lamb, a guide
from Keene Valley, the southern base of the Giant of
the Valley Mountain, Essex County, New York, on the
14th of July, 1898. A road runs from Keene Heights
to Port Henry, through the gap between the south base
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
of the Giant of the Valley and the north base of Round
Mountain, and passes close to a small lake called Chapel
Pond. Some three hundred meters west of this lake,
we left the road and struck north, across the brook, into
the thick, mossy woods. After perhaps one hundred
meters, we came to a talus of great boulders of Laurentian
rock, with the cliffs of the Giant, whence the boulders had
fallen, rising steeply above. We found ice under several
of them, although never in any quantity. The thermometer,
after an exposure of fifteen minutes in one of
these little hollows, registered 6&deg; C., although not more
than one meter from where the sunshine fell on the moss.
In the shade of a tree one meter distant from the same
hollow it registered 26&deg; C.; a difference of 20&deg; C. at a
distance of only two meters.</p>

<p>Perhaps one kilometer east of Chapel Pond, there is a
place, where the bases of the mountains come much nearer
together, which bears the name of &ldquo;The Narrows.&rdquo; Here
we crossed the brook again, and, after some fifteen or
twenty meters of scrambling through rough woods, reached
once more the talus of the Giant, composed of tremendous
boulders. Among these we found ice in many places and
this time in large quantities. Within one boulder cave we
found an ice slab some four meters in length, by two
meters in width, and one meter in thickness. This was
pure, hard and non-prismatic ice, and was evidently not
formed of compressed snow: in fact snow could not have
drifted in under the boulder. We broke off a large piece
of ice and took it back to Saint Hubert&rsquo;s Inn, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
melted rather slowly. From the mouth of this cave an
icy draught issued, and, as it struck the warmer air outside,
a slight mist was formed. Mr. Lamb said that from
the road itself he had sometimes seen mist rising from
this talus. Further explorations of the talus of the
Giant would probably reveal ice in many other places
than those we examined.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Mr. E. I. H. Howell examined several times, in 1899, the talus
of the Giant of the Valley. He found ice in many places; also cold air
currents blowing out. At one spot, there is a spring which flows all
through the summer, and the water is so cold, that its temperature is
little above that of melting ice. Mr. Howell found, as at Ausable
Pond, spring flowers growing in mid-summer among the rocks of the
talus.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Lamb told me of two other places in the Adirondacks,
where he found ice in similar boulder formations.
One was in the talus of Mount Wallface in Indian Pass,
between Mounts Wallface and McIntyre. The other was
in the talus of Mount McIntyre in Avalanche Pass, between
Mounts McIntyre and Colden. At the latter place, he
found it near the trail going round the lake in the pass.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE ICE GULCH, RANDOLPH.</p>

<p>The Randolph Ice Gulch is situated in Randolph
Township, New Hampshire, about eight kilometers from
Randolph Station, on the Boston and Maine Railroad.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I
visited it on August 11th, 1898. At the Mount Crescent
House, I found a guide in the person of Mr. Charles E.
Lowe, Jr. The excursion took us about six hours. The
trail was a rough bush path, cut by the Appalachian
Mountain Club, and which had not been cleaned out that
year. It was a cloudy but hot day and this, combined
with the badness of the road, made the walk fatiguing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> I first heard of the Ice Gulch from Mr. John Ritchie, Jr., of Boston.
Some years ago in the middle of July, he found ice plentiful in
the second chamber. He thought the Gulch only a refrigerator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>The Gulch lies between Crescent and Black Mountains.
The altitude of the upper end of the Gulch is
something over eight hundred meters, that of the lower
end about six hundred meters. It is some fifteen hundred
meters long, and averages perhaps one hundred
meters in width at the top, and only a few meters at the
bottom. The depth may be about seventy-five meters and
the sides are steep, in some places sheer. The bottom is
a mass of broken, fallen rocks, with a good many trees
growing among them. There are several steps, so to
speak, in the Gulch, which are called chambers, although
the term seems rather meaningless. Promenading through
the bottom of the Gulch was fraught with difficulty, because
the rocks were placed in most unsuitable positions
for human progression, and my hands were certainly as
useful to me as my feet in preserving equilibrium. We
found ice in one or two places, but not in any great
quantity. In one spot it was overlaid by water. My
guide said that there was less ice than the year before.
A large piece which we broke off, and which furnished us
with a cooling morsel of frozen fluid, was full of air
bubbles. It was not prismatic ice, and was certainly unusual
in formation. It crunched up under the teeth and,
although it did not look like solidified snow, yet, judging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
from its position among the boulders, it was doubtless
formed from the melting and refreezing of snow.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> My
guide said he had heard that fresh ice began to form
sometimes in September. The Gulch is well protected
against wind, and I detected no draughts among the
rocks. Except in the immediate vicinity of the ice, the
temperature was not abnormally low.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> On the 17th of February, 1899, four days after the greatest snow
storm in Philadelphia in many years, I noticed that the snow on my
roof solidified slowly into a mass of ice which contained a good many
air-bubbles. It strikingly resembled the ice of the Ice Gulch, only that
it was more solid and did not have more than half as many air-bubbles.</p></div>

<p>On returning to the Mount Crescent House, I had a
talk with Mr. Charles E. Lowe, Sr., who told me that
Alpine plants, like those which grow on Mount Washington
and Mount Adams, are found in the Gulch; but that
they do not exist on the neighboring Black and Crescent
Mountains. He said also that ice was present in more
than one place in King&rsquo;s Ravine, and that it was always
there.</p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING BOULDER TALUS AT RUMNEY.</p>

<p>About three kilometers south of Rumney, New Hampshire,
there is a hill called Bald Mountain, which, about
three hundred meters west of the carriage road from
Rumney to Plymouth, descends as a big cliff, with an
exposure facing nearly southeast. At the base of this
cliff, there is a talus<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which I visited on the 27th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
August, 1898, with the Sheriff of Rumney, Mr. Learned.
He said he had found plenty of ice there on the 18th of
August, 1897, but he doubted whether there would be
any left this year, on account of the hot weather. Effectively
a careful hunt failed to reveal any ice, although the
talus was just the kind of place where it might have been
expected, as the boulders were piled one over the other
and in one or two places there were considerable hollows.
The temperatures were normal, and there were
no draughts. The talus is exposed to the sun, and only
moderately sheltered against wind by a scrub forest. But
there can be no doubt, that ice lingers there long after it
has disappeared from every other spot in the neighborhood,
and it seems as if our not finding any, is another
proof that it is the heat of summer which melts it away.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Mr. John Ritchie, Jr., wrote me about this place, where he had
found ice plentiful some years ago in August, within two or three
meters from the outside: he considered it only a refrigerator.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">ICE FORMATIONS AND WINDHOLES AT WATERTOWN.</p>

<p>At Watertown, New York, on the south side of the
Black River, in the town itself, are some natural cracks or
crevices in the limestone rocks. They are only a short
distance from the New York Central Railroad station.
The cracks enter the northern side of the railroad embankment,
pass under the railroad tracks, and extend some
distance back. In front of them are four cellars, used for
storing beer kegs. The lessor, Mr. Ehrlicher, obligingly
had the cellars opened for me, on the 12th of September,
1898. There was neither ice nor draughts in the
cellars, and the temperature was normal. Mr. Ehrlicher
said that in the spring there was ice in the
cracks, but that it had all melted away as the result of
the hot summer.</p>

<p>About four kilometers west of Watertown, on the
south bank of the Black River, is the picnic ground of Glen
Park, which is reached by trolley. The manager of the
restaurant walked around the park with me. In one
spot is a hollow or glen at the base of a small, much
cracked limestone cliff, which has a northern exposure.
The manager said that snow and ice usually lies in this
place until June, not only among the broken rocks, but
even in the open. Sometimes ice remains among the
boulders all summer, but only near the front of the
boulders, and by pushing in, one soon gets beyond it:
we found none, a fact showing once more the effect of
the unusually warm summer. On hot days, draughts
issue from between the boulders, but as the day was
cool, we did not notice any. The spot is well sheltered
against the wind by a number of trees; and the shape
of the hollow reminded me of the glen in front of the
Eishöhle bei Roth.</p>

<p>Not one hundred meters from this hollow, is a little
limestone cave, closed by a wooden door, which excludes
any cold air in winter. The cave is lighted by electric
lights, and is a narrow, crooked, descending fissure, a <i>ganghöhle</i>,
where the marks of water action are plainly visible.
At the bottom a little stream, evidently the active agent in
forming the cave, ran through the fissured limestone. In
the stream a large toad or frog was swimming about.
There was nothing icy about the cave or the water, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
temperature was normal. Ice was never known to form
in the cave. These two places, so close together, are an
interesting confirmation that it is only where the outside
cold can get in, that we find subterranean ice.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FREEZING CAVE AND FREEZING WELLS OF DECORAH.</p>

<p>Near Decorah, Iowa, is a freezing cavern, which is
more frequently referred to in cave literature than is generally
the case. I visited it on Friday, September the 30th,
1898, with an old English resident of Decorah, Mr. W. D.
Selby-Hill. The cave is situated about one kilometer to
the northward of Decorah, on the north bank of the
Upper Iowa River, at the base of a bluff. It is some
thirty to forty meters above the stream, and faces southward.
It looks like a fault or fissure in the rocks, with
the sides meeting a few meters overhead. It is a true
cave, but probably in an early stage of formation, for
there are no apparent traces of water action, nor any
stalagmites nor stalactites. The absence of the latter
may, however, be due to the fact that it is a periodic
glacière. The rock is a white limestone, rich in fossils.
The cave is some two to three meters in width and is
rather winding, with a short arm or pocket branching
out on the west side. The main cave runs back some
thirty meters from the entrance. In one place it is
necessary to stoop, to get past some overhanging rock
slabs. By candle light, we went to the rear of the cave,
and found it warm, dry, and free from ice. There were
no draughts, possibly because the day was cool.</p>

<p>I looked in vain for <i>tubular fissures</i>, or indeed any
fissures, through which <i>water might freeze by pressure in
its descent</i>, as the believers in the capillary theory say it
does. Nothing of the kind existed, and I wrote in my
note-book: &ldquo;Writing on the very spot about which this
theory was started, I feel justified in asserting that the
theory amounts to absolutely nothing and is entirely incorrect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hill told me that there were two wells in the
southern portion of Decorah Township, where ice was
found in summer. I visited them both, but found no ice,
and the temperatures normal. Mr. Hill said that one of
the wells was dug about thirty years ago, and that the
workman told him that the ground which he went through
was frozen; and that at one place he struck an opening,
from which came so strong a current of icy air, that it was
hard to keep at work.</p>

<p>I talked to several persons afterwards. <i>Inter alia</i>, they
told me that the bluff was a great place for rattlesnakes,
sometimes big ones. They admitted also generally that
they were puzzled about the formation of ice in the cave.
Some claimed that the ice formed in summer&mdash;the old
story once more. I met, however, Mr. Alois F. Kovarik
of the Decorah Institute, who had made a series of regular
observations for over a year and found that the ice begins
to form about the end of March and beginning of April,
and is at its maximum towards the beginning of June.
Mr. Kovarik also told me, that he had found ice in one
of the wells in the beginning of August.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span></p>

<p>This was an especially satisfactory trip to me, for it
did away, once for all, with any possible belief that there
was any basis of fact for the capillary theory. It also
seems to me important to find that the ice of these
freezing wells melts in summer. For it shows that their
ice is due to the same causes as those which form the ice
in the cave, and is another proof against the validity of
the glacial period theory.</p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING ROCK TALUS ON SPRUCE CREEK.</p>

<p>On Spruce Creek, Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania,
about four kilometers north of the Pennsylvania Railroad
depot, is an ice bearing talus, known locally as the Ice
Holes or Ice Caves. I visited this spot, on October the
5th, 1898, with Mr. Benner, of Spruce Creek. We
walked up the pretty valley along the old Pittsburgh
turnpike, at one place finding some papaw trees, whose
fruit had a horrible sickening taste; then we crossed
Spruce Creek by a footbridge and followed the other bank
back for some five hundred meters, until we were nearly
opposite the old Colerain Forge, which is located in a
piece of land called by the curious name of Africa.
About half way from the bridge we smelt a strange
odor, which my companion thought came from a copperhead
or rattlesnake: we did not investigate.</p>

<p>The freezing talus is situated at the foot of Tussey
Mountain: it is big, and is composed of small sandstone
(?) rock débris. The talus is at least thirty meters
high and one hundred and twenty meters long. As I
stood at the bottom, I was reminded strongly of the talus
at the Dornburg. At the base were a number of small
pits, evidently dug by man. From the interstices between
the rocks, icy cold draughts issued in some places,
and there was no doubt that there was plenty of ice
beneath the stones. In one place we thought we could
see ice, and I poked at the white substance with my stick,
but I am not positive that it was ice. All over the talus,
the temperature was strikingly colder than a few meters
away, and in the pits we could see our breaths distinctly.
Although I am not much of a botanist, yet it seemed to
me that the flora immediately near the talus was somewhat
different in character from that of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>Mr. Benner told me that he saw, three or four weeks
before, plenty of ice in the pits; that they were made by
farmers who formerly came to this spot to get ice; and
that parties occasionally picnic here in the summer and
make ice cream. He stated also that he saw, some years
ago, a small cave or hole containing ice near Mapleton,
Pennsylvania, but that it was destroyed by quarrying the
rock away.</p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING GORGE NEAR ELLENVILLE.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October the 9th, 1898, with a young man
from Ellenville, I visited the well known Ellenville Gorge,
in the Shawangunk Range, Ulster County, New York.
We left the hotel at eight-forty A. M. and reached the
gorge, known locally as the Ice Cave, at ten-five A. M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
It is about four kilometers northeast from Ellenville. The
path rises steadily uphill and is of the roughest description;
it is covered with loose stones, and looks as if it
might become the bed of a mountain brook in wet
weather.</p>

<p>I call this place a gorge, instead of a cave, because it is
uncovered at the top, but probably originally it was
covered. It is shaped like a pit cave minus a roof, and
it reminded me of the Friedrichsteiner Eishöhle, and the
Glacières de Saint-Georges and du Pré de Saint-Livres.
It is entered by a long slope from the western end, the
gorge turning northward further back. I estimated its
width, at the bottom at some five to seven meters, at the
top at some three to four meters; its length at some thirty
meters and the deepest point we reached, at some twenty
meters below the surface. These are guesses, however.
In one place, a great rock slab overhangs the gorge.
At nearly the lowest point of the rock floor, there is
a hole which extends perpendicularly downwards some
five or ten meters more; this opening is partly blocked
up with fallen masses of rock which would make a further
descent perilous. The north end of the gorge is also filled
up with a mass of great broken rocks; in fact, the whole
place is out of repair, as the rocks are cracked and creviced
on both sides to a great extent. The rock is friable and
seems to be all breaking up, or rather down, and I think
there is some danger from falling stones, although I did
not see any fall. There is a good deal of moss on the sides
of the gorge, and on some ledges small evergreens are
growing. The gorge is sheltered thoroughly from winds
by its formation and position, and somewhat by the
scrub forest surrounding it. There are several long,
deep crevices a few meters further up the mountain
side, and I think one of them is an extension of the
main gorge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span></p>

<p>We found no ice. It generally lasts till about the
beginning of September; and Professor Angelo Heilprin,
and Miss Julia L. Lewis, of Philadelphia, have found
plenty of it in July and August. But the ice had evidently
now been gone for some time, for the temperature
at the bottom of the gorge was about 11&deg; C. at
ten-thirty A. M. This was but little colder than the
temperature v outside, which at ten-fifteen A. M. was
14&deg; C.</p>

<p>On returning to Ellenville, I learnt that there was
another somewhat similar smaller gorge, some eight kilometers
away, at a place called Sam&rsquo;s Point. This, however,
is said to retain only snow, while in the Ellenville gorge
much ice is sometimes formed, and icicles a couple of
meters long are said to hang on the sides of the cliffs.
The proprietor of the hotel told me he had heard of a cave
which contained ice not far from Albany, at a place called
Carlisle, on the Delaware and Hudson Railroad.</p>


<p class="caption3">FREEZING CAVE AND WINDHOLES NEAR FARRANDSVILLE.</p>

<p>I arrived at Farrandsville, Clinton County, Pennsylvania,
early on Tuesday morning, October the 11th, 1898,
and found a boy, who worked in a brick mill, as guide to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
the caves.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> After emptying a small, flat bottomed boat
of the water of which it was half full, we rowed across
the Susquehanna River; then we walked up the road,
along the river bank, for a couple of hundred meters, and
struck up the so-called path to the caves. Although the
whole of the mountain side was at the disposal of the road
maker, no better plan seems to have suggested itself than
to make the track go straight up. This saved making
zigzags, yet the result is that the path is steep, and as
it is rocky and slippery, it is hard travelling without
bootnails or alpenstock.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> I learned of this cave from Mr. Eugene F. McCabe, of Renovo,
Pennsylvania. Mr. McCabe took out large pieces of ice from it in
the month of August. On December 23d, 1896, he found no ice
inside the cave, but a hoar frost covered the rocks; the temperature
outside was -5.6&deg;; inside -4.5&deg;: the day was clear and there was no
breeze; several matches lighted in the cave were almost instantly
blown out by a current of air coming from crevices in the rocks.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ira C. Chatham, postmaster at Farrandsville, wrote to me on the
19th of October, 1898, as follows: &ldquo;Your paper on Ice Caves
[Journal of the Franklin Institute, March, 1897] at pp. 177 and 178
describes the Farrandsville Cave as near as is possible, as the ice
forms in the spring from the snow melting and dropping through the
rocks into the cave, and the rocks face directly north as stated.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>As we went up, I noticed, in one or two places, cold
draughts issuing from crevices in the rocks. We soon
came to a hollow under a rock, where there were a number
of cracks and crevices: the boy spoke of it as the lower
cave. It is some sixty meters above the Susquehanna
River and cold draughts flowed from the cracks, although
we saw no ice. The cave was about twenty meters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
higher up. One could crawl into it for a couple of meters,
and all round it the rocks are somewhat creviced;
in fact, I think there are a good many cracks in the entire
hill. There was no ice in sight in this hole, but a strong,
cold draught poured from it. After an exposure of fifteen
minutes the thermometer registered 6&deg; C.; while outside,
in the shade, it stood at 15&deg; C. This decidedly sub-normal
temperature proved unmistakably, in my opinion, the
presence of ice a little further than we could see in.
Both holes face about north and are sheltered, by their
position and by the sparse forest which covers the ridge,
against all winds except those from the north.</p>

<p>I talked to the postmaster and the railroad agent at
Farrandsville on my return, and they stated that there
was no ice in the hole in winter, but that it formed
about April and remained over until towards September,
showing that the cave is a normal glacière on a
small scale.</p>


<p class="caption3">GLACIÈRES NEAR SUMMIT.</p>

<p>In the search for coal, the mountains of the Appalachian
Chain between the little town of Summit, and the
neighboring village of Coaldale, Carbon County, Pennsylvania,
were mined and tunneled in every direction. Owing
to the caving in of some of these mines, depressions
formed in certain places along the ridge in the upper surface
of the ground, and in two of these hollows natural
refrigerators occur. These were brought to my notice by
Mr. C. J. Nicholson of Philadelphia, and I visited them on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
May the 5th, 1899, in company with two coal miners of
Summit.</p>

<p>Starting from Summit, we passed across some rough
ground under which there was a mine on fire; and the
miners showed me the tops of two pipes sticking out of
the ground, from which issued a smoke or steam, too hot
to hold the hand in more than a few seconds. Going
beyond through brushwood, for a couple of hundred
meters, we came to the first glacière, which was also the
nearest to Summit. It faced almost due north and looked
as if it was formerly the entrance to a mine. It was fairly
big, and my companions assured me that, until within
about a year, ice was always found in it. Recently, however,
part, of the rock roof fell in, blocking up the entrance
with a mass of débris and making it unsafe to venture in.
Formerly parties of tourists constantly visited this place,
after coming over the Switchback, but this is no longer
done and there has been some talk of cleaning away the
broken rocks and making the glacière accessible. The
men also said that occasionally people living in the
neighborhood had dug out the ice for their own use.</p>

<p>The other glacière was a short distance further, in the
direction of Coaldale. It is in a pit, which may have
been the mouth of a disused shaft or only a depression
resulting from a cave-in. A scrubby forest, which surrounds
the hollow, acts as a windbrake. A rather steep
slope leads down into the pit, and at the end passes
under the wall of rock of the opposite side for a short
distance, forming a small cave, which faces almost due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
south and whose floor is choked up with broken rock
fragments. At the bottom of the slope we found some
snow, and among the boulders a good deal of snow-ice as
well as several long icicles hanging from the rocks. All
the ice and snow lay on the north side of the rocks, or
underneath them, so that it was in shady places where the
sun could not reach it. The temperature was not at all
uncomfortable, although somewhat cool and damp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97f" id="Page_97f"></a></span></p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9. Vertical Section of Pit near Summit.</span></div>
</div>

<p>There was nothing in either glacière, to show that the
ice was formed from any other cause than the drifting in,
and melting and refreezing of the winter&rsquo;s snow; and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
impression is that the ice in the second glacière could
not last through the summer.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE SNOW HOLE NEAR WILLIAMSTOWN.</p>

<p>The Snow Hole near Williamstown (Massachusetts) is
situated near the northern end of the Petersburgh Mountain
of the Taghconic Range; it is slightly below the watershed
on the Williamstown side, at an altitude of about
seven hundred meters. The Snow Hole is in the State of
New York, near the boundary between New York and
Massachusetts. It is a long two hours&rsquo; drive from Williamstown,
the last four kilometers or so, over an exceedingly
steep and rough road, which is, in fact, nothing but
an old logging road, and the worst I ever drove over
except the road to Démenyfálva.</p>

<p>I visited the Snow Hole with my brother on Friday,
September the 29th, 1899. It is surrounded by a dense
forest, mainly of recent growth, which thoroughly shelters
it from all winds. In shape and appearance it resembles
the Gorge at Ellenville, except that it is smaller: its location
on the ridge is not unlike that of the Friedrichsteiner
Eishöhle. It is a narrow crack&mdash;or cave minus a
roof&mdash;about fifteen meters long, six to seven meters
deep and from two to five meters wide. It faces nearly
north, and the bottom is in perpetual shadow. From
the northern end, a gentle slope leads to the rear. The
slope was a good deal blocked up by a big tree with
large branches, which had fallen directly into the fissure.
There was some moss or greenish mould on the rocks in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
places, and at the rear end of the slope there were some
fissures in the rocks, into which one might perhaps have
crawled a little farther, which formed a tiny cave. There
was also a similar incipient cave at the northern end.
I could not detect any draughts issuing from these rock
fissures, and the air throughout was still, although the
wind was blowing hard on the ridge. The rocks were
moist in places and the air damp, but there was neither
snow nor ice and the temperatures were normal. The
driver told me that he had found plenty of snow in the
base of the gorge some years ago in July; and he
said that he had always heard that snow was found
in the Snow Hole all the year round. All the conditions
of the place, the shape of the fissure, and its
sheltered northern exposition, are favorable to the retention
of ice and snow, and it is not surprising that
they remain over every spring.</p>


<p class="caption3">ICY GULF NEAR GREAT BARRINGTON.</p>

<p>The Icy Gulf or Icy Glen is some eight kilometers
from Great Barrington, Massachusetts. I have not been
in it, but was told in October, 1899, by the farmers living
near by, that after snowy winters, ice remains over
through July. It must be similar to the Icy Glen at
Stockbridge.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE ICE BED OF WALLINGFORD.</p>

<p>The Ice Bed of Wallingford is situated about three
kilometers to the east of Wallingford, Vermont. A drive
of half an hour, over the Mount Holly and Hearburrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
roads, takes the visitor to the entrance of a rough wood
path, which, at a distance of three or four hundred meters,
leads to the Ice Bed. This is a huge talus, at the base of
the White Rock Mountain, whose cliffs rise steeply overhead
for some three or four hundred meters. The talus,
which was doubtless formed by a great slide at some
distant date, consists of granite boulders, some of which
are big ones. The ice-bearing portion may be some
thirty or forty meters high vertically. It lies in a sort of
gully or rock basin, and at the top is about thirty meters
broad, tapering to a point at the bottom. The talus faces
southward, and during a good part of the day the sun
shines full upon it. A thin forest fringes the sides and
grows round the bottom, but this can afford but little
protection from the winds, especially to those from the
south.</p>

<p>I visited this place on the 5th of October, 1899. There
was a distinct drop in temperature as we neared the base
of the talus, and a cool air drew gently down over the
rocks. I think slight draughts issued from some of the
crevices; but of this I am not sure. The temperature was
sub-normal, about 8&deg;, but hardly low enough to prove the
presence of ice, although we could see our breaths distinctly.
We looked carefully under a number of the
boulders, but neither ice nor snow was visible. I was
assured that ice was abundant there in the past July
and August, and I should think it had melted away only
shortly before my visit. My impression is, that this is a
periodic glacière.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">CAVES NEAR WILLIAMSTOWN.</p>

<p>On the eastern slope of the Petersburgh Mountain of
the Taghconic Range in Massachusetts, at a good deal
lower altitude than the Williamstown Snow Hole and
about southeast of it are some caverns, which are but
little known. A five or six kilometer drive from Williamstown
takes the visitor to the base of the mountain, whence
a rather steep ascent of about a kilometer and a half
brings him to the caves, which are in the midst of a dense,
scrub forest.</p>

<p>The caves were first entered, and possibly discovered,
by Mr. W. F. Williams, of Williamstown, when a boy.
Since then, he has visited them many times and explored
them a good deal. They do not appear to have any name
as yet, and it would seem only fitting to christen them
after their explorer: the Williams Caves.</p>

<p>There are several unimportant holes in the immediate
neighborhood of the two main caves. The latter lie side
by side. The rock formation is the same as that of the
Snow Hole, a dark gray slate with a few veins of quartz,
and they are due also evidently to the same geological
causes. It would seem as though the mountain had
tended to open or crack at these spots and fallen apart.
This seems probable, because wherever there is a projection
on one side of the cracks, there is a corresponding
hollow in the opposite side. After this, water action
has come, and erosion and corrosion have worn out and
carried away earthy matter, and slowly deepened and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">« 102 »</a></span>
widened the fissures. The remarkable point in connection
with the main caves, however, is that one is a
normal cave and the other a periodic glacière.</p>

<p>I went with Mr. Williams to these caves on the 6th
of October, 1899, and partially explored the glacière.
On the way up, just as we left the carriage road, a fine,
three-year-old buck, in his winter coat, came bounding out
of the forest; on seeing us he stopped, and after taking
a good look, quietly trotted off into the bushes.</p>

<p>The glacière is rather peculiar in shape and may be
described as two storied. A long slope, set at an angle
of some forty degrees, and covered with mud and dead
leaves, leads down into the crack, which is from one to
three meters in width. The first half of the slope is open
to the sky; the last half is covered by the rock roof,
and is a real cave. In this the floor is horizontal, the
place forming a little chamber in which the daylight has
almost vanished. At the exact summit of the slope a big
tree grew most conveniently; and we tied to this one
end of a twenty-meter Austrian Alpine Club rope, and
by holding fast to it, and kneeling or sitting down in the
mud in two or three places, the descent was easy enough.
It was rather difficult to scramble up the slope again,

<p>In the floor of the little chamber there are two holes,
and, stepping over these, we stood at the rear end, about
eighteen meters distant from the beginning of the slope.
My companion now set some birchbark on fire and
dropped it into the innermost hole, and we laid down in
turn, flat on the rock floor, and craned our necks through
the hole. Mr. Williams thought he could see ice below
us. I looked down after him and found that I was looking
into a lower chamber whose sides were invisible.
The floor was some three meters below vertically, and on
this the birchbark was burning brightly. I think I saw
some ice, but I could not be sure, as there was too much
smoke to see distinctly. My companion offered to go
down through the hole and get some ice; a proposition I
promptly vetoed, as had anything gone wrong, I could
not possibly have given him any assistance, as there was
no extra rope. Mr. Williams told me that he went down
several times before in July or August, and always found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
ice on the slanting floor. He said he did not know how
far this lower chamber extended, nor the length of the
ice floor. One thing which makes me hesitate to think
that we saw ice was, that the temperature of the chamber
where we were was not at all icy; but probably&mdash;I had
forgotten my thermometer&mdash;nearly normal.</p>

<p>When we stood once more by the tree at the top of
the slope, the mouth of another cave was visible about
two meters below us. Mr. Williams said it had never
looked more than a little crack before, and that the opening
was much bigger than at his last visit. It was directly
under the slope by which we descended and it vanished
into darkness. Its direction led straight towards the
lower chamber, and it almost surely leads to it. It seems
thus that there are two hollows, one directly above the
other; and that the lower one is a glacière, while the
upper one is not. The cold air of winter would naturally
sink into the lower chamber, and the spring thaws would
furnish plenty of drip, so that this place seems to answer
every requirement of a cave glacière.</p>

<p>But the most interesting fact about these caves is
that, while the shallower one is a glacière, the bigger
and deeper one is not. This is situated about ten meters
north of the glacière and the direction of the entrance
is about the same. Mr. Williams has found snow and
ice in May in the entrance pit as far as the daylight
goes, but none beyond. I am inclined to think that the
explanation of this is the fact that the cave is a <i>ganghöhle</i>
or tunnel cave. Mr. Williams described it as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
narrow passage with chambers, and at least a hundred
meters long, and fifty meters in depth below the surface.
The cold air sinks in a certain distance, but as the passage
is narrow and long, and too winding for any strong
draughts, the cold air which enters is soon neutralized
by the supply of warmer air within and by contact with
the rocks. I cannot help thinking that it is by some
such explanation that we must hope to solve the problem
of why certain caves are glacières and others in
the immediate neighborhood normal caves; and the caves
near Williamstown are exceptional in presenting the
problem so patently.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Terminology.</i>&mdash;Ice enduring the entire year is found,
in temperate latitudes, in a variety of forms and in
several different kinds of places. In some cases it is
entirely above the surface of the earth; in others it is
entirely beneath the surface of the earth. These are the
extremes, and between them there are certain intermediate
forms. The perennial ice above ground of temperate
regions has gradually become known in English
by the French word <i>glacier</i>, but strange to say, there is
no term in use in English which accurately describes the
perennial ice formations which are partially or completely
underground. Thus the term &ldquo;ice cave&rdquo; is applied to
a rock cavern containing ice, and the term &ldquo;ice gorge&rdquo;
to a rock gorge containing ice. Both terms are misleading,
because the character of the contents is mentioned
before the nature of the geological formation. We
say correctly enough &ldquo;limestone cave&rdquo; or &ldquo;lava cave&rdquo;
and, in my opinion, we should apply the term &ldquo;ice cave&rdquo;
in a similar manner to the hollows in the ice at the lower
end of glaciers, whence the glacier waters make their
exit. These are really &ldquo;ice caves,&rdquo; that is caves with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
sides and roof made of ice. Another trouble of the term
&ldquo;ice cave,&rdquo; as applied to rock formations containing
ice, is that it is not generic: not only is it incorrect, but
also it is not comprehensive. It does not apply to mines,
tunnels, wells, gullies, boulder taluses, or underground
ice sheets. If &ldquo;ice cave&rdquo; is used, except in its true
sense of glacier ice cave, it seems at least as though it
should be so only for real caves which retain ice, as
opposed to taluses and wells. Curiously enough, the
Germans are just as inaccurate as ourselves, for their
terms <i>eishöhle</i> and <i>eisloch</i> are absolute translations of our
&ldquo;ice cave&rdquo; and &ldquo;ice hole.&rdquo; Indeed, there is no doubt
that some of the incorrect notions about subterranean
ice formations, are due to the inaccuracy of the terminology.</p>

<p>The only language, so far as I know, which has a
correct and really generic term for subterranean ice
formations, is the French in its word <i>glacière</i>. The
French and Swiss say <i>glacières naturelles</i> of ice deposits
formed naturally underground; and <i>glacières artificielles</i>
of ice houses. <i>Glacière naturelle</i> is comprehensive and
accurate. It covers all the rock formations and suggests
also the mode of formation of the ice. It likewise implies
the strong resemblance between natural ice deposits and
artificial ice houses. It might be well, therefore, if the
French term <i>glacière</i> were adopted as a generic term for
all underground ice formations. As, however, there is
little likelihood of this happening, the question arises as
to the best English equivalent or equivalents. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span>
seem to be &ldquo;freezing cavern, freezing talus,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;natural
refrigerator&rdquo; or &ldquo;subterranean ice formation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Natural
refrigerator&rdquo; and &ldquo;subterranean ice formation&rdquo; are more
generic than &ldquo;freezing cavern, freezing well,&rdquo; etc.; but
the latter have the advantage of suggesting immediately
that reference is made to the hollows of the earth which
at times contain ice; and, therefore, they are the best
terms, perhaps, which can be chosen in English.</p>

<p>Another point in the terminology of this subject
has reference to subterranean hollows where draughts
issue or enter. Such hollows are found in all parts of
the world and are known usually in English as &ldquo;blowing
caves&rdquo; or &ldquo;cold current caves.&rdquo; The Germans speak
of them as <i>windröhren</i> or <i>windlöcher</i>. In my first paper
about caves,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I used the word &ldquo;windhole&rdquo; which
I translated from the German. The term &ldquo;windhole&rdquo;
seems to me preferable to &ldquo;blowing cave&rdquo; or &ldquo;cold
current cave&rdquo; in that it is more generic. It applies to
taluses or boulder heaps, or in fact, to any hollows
where draughts issue or enter, whether these hollows
are genuine caverns or not.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> <i>Ice Caves and the Causes of Subterranean Ice</i>, November 1896,
and March 1897.</p></div>

<p>It is necessary also to explain here that &ldquo;glacière&rdquo;
and &ldquo;windhole&rdquo; are not synonymous terms. It must be
understood that a glacière or natural refrigerator is a
place where ice forms and endures in a subterranean
or semi-subterranean situation; and that <i>the presence of
ice</i> is the criterion of whether a place is or is not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span>
glacière. Likewise it must be understood that a windhole
or blowing cave is an underground hollow with at
least two openings, and in which distinct draughts occur;
and that the <i>presence of draughts</i> is necessary to constitute
a place a windhole or blowing cave. A freezing
cavern may or may not be a windhole, and a windhole
may or may not be a freezing cavern.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Temperatures.</i>&mdash;The phenomena of glacières are so
closely connected with temperatures that it seems necessary
at this point to mention some general facts in
connection with subterranean temperatures, even if these
still form a subject of some uncertainty, and one about
which further observation is desirable. Subterranean
temperatures may be grouped under three heads: 1,
Ordinary or normal temperatures; 2, Temperatures
above the normal or super-normal temperatures; 3,
Temperatures below the normal or sub-normal temperatures.</p>

<p>1. In the great majority of caves, cellars and subterranean
places of all descriptions, the temperature of the
air is about the same, all the year round, as that of the
ground. The frost of winter and the heat of summer
penetrate the earth for some trivial distance, a few
meters perhaps, and lower or raise the temperature of
the ground temporarily. Below this there is a stratum
where the temperature is found to vary but little the entire
year and which, in a majority of cases, approximates
the mean annual temperature of the district. Below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span>
this invariable stratum, the temperature generally rises
slowly, not at exactly the same rate everywhere, but in a
regular increase. This increase of temperature averages
1&deg; C. for every 32 meters. As most caves and cellars
are of small depth and as they take their temperatures
from that of the ground, it follows that as a rule their
temperatures are moderate and pleasant. And as the
air of the majority of caves and subterranean hollows
is about the same as the temperature of the surrounding
rock, it is correct to call subterranean air temperatures
closely approximating the ordinary temperature of
the ground, ordinary or normal temperatures.</p>

<p>As already stated, with an increase of depth, there
is, in almost all cases, a regular increase of temperature.
For this reason, mines, which are much the deepest hollows
reached by man in the surface of the earth, are, as a
rule, warmer in the lower levels: if deep, they are also
hot. And this is so generally the case that warmer
temperatures at the bottom of mines may be considered
as normal.</p>

<p>2. In a few hollows close to the surface, there are
temperatures much above the normal temperature of the
ground. Such places are rare and abnormal.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The
heat is generally due to the presence of hot springs or
to some volcanic action in the immediate neighborhood.
In the case of one cave close to the surface, the heat
is due to some limekilns which are situated immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span>
overhead.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Where these warm hollows are genuine
caves it seems proper to call them &ldquo;hot caves.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>3. In a number of places, there are abnormally low
temperatures underground either for the whole or only
for part of the year. Although commoner than hot caves,
yet the underground places with low temperatures are
also rare and abnormal. They may be divided into two
groups: 1, Those where the temperatures are lower
than the normal, without becoming low enough for ice
to form; and 2, Those where the temperature sinks so
low, that ice forms.</p>


<p class="pmt2">It is difficult to make definite divisions among the
various forms of natural refrigerators, but it is correct,
probably, to classify them under five heads, in accordance
with the different kinds of formations of the hollows in
the rocks:</p>

<p>1. Gullies, gorges, and troughs where ice and snow
remain.</p>

<p>2. Soil or rocks overlaying ice sheets.</p>

<p>3. Taluses and boulder heaps retaining ice.</p>

<p>4. Wells, mines and tunnels in which ice sometimes
forms.</p>

<p>5. Caves with abnormally low temperatures, and often
containing ice.</p>


<p class="pmt2">1. <i>Gorges and Troughs.</i>&mdash;Gullies, gorges and basins
which retain snow and ice are fairly numerous in mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
districts. They are generally ravines, or rock
fissures, or hollows, in positions below the snow line
where snow and ice are sufficiently protected, from sun
and wind, to remain long after snow in the surrounding
open country, at the same altitude, has melted
away. Some of these gorges are small, some big. As
a rule, they are deep and narrow.</p>

<p>In north-eastern Siberia, a form of permanent surface
ice is found, which the Tungusses speak of as <i>tarinnen</i>,
which means &ldquo;ice troughs&rdquo; or &ldquo;ice valleys.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
These <i>tarinnen</i> are broad valleys, with either a horizontal
floor or one sloping gently in the form of a
trough, over which the ice is spread in the form of
a sheet. The Tungusses assert that the ice in some
of these troughs never wholly melts away, although it
lessens in quantity from the beginning of May till the
end of August, after which it once more increases.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Subterranean Ice Sheets.</i>&mdash;In several places in different
parts of the world there are underground ice sheets
which extend over large spaces; they are common under
the tundras of Alaska; and there are fine examples
on Kotzebue Sound,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> on the Kowak River,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
seems to be a formation of the same kind. Several examples
of these subterranean ice sheets are reported
also from different parts of the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>A somewhat different kind of ice sheet was observed
on Mount Etna. Sir Charles Lyell<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> speaks of it
as a &ldquo;glacier preserved by a covering of lava.&rdquo; He
says Signor Mario Gemmellaro satisfied himself that
nothing but a flowing of lava over snow could account
for the position of the glacier. Ice sheets somewhat
similar to these are reported from Tierra del Fuego,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and probably also such sheets occur in Iceland; and
enormous heaps of ice covered with sand are found
on Mount Chimborazo.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> On the northwestern coast
of Greenland, glaciers, whose flow has stopped, were
observed buried under an accumulation of moss and
grass.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Taluses and Boulder Heaps.</i>&mdash;Taluses and broken
debris, and in general boulder heaps of all sorts, have
interstices and openings between the boulders, and in
these it occasionally happens that ice is found. This is
most common among the taluses at the base of cliffs,
but in some cases ice is found among broken rocks on
the sides of gently sloping hills, or even on the plateaus
of their summits. Sometimes the ice and snow on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
bottom of rock gorges all melts away, while further
down, in the hollows of the boulders forming the floor,
ice still remains. The rocks of which these ice bearing
taluses are formed are generally gneiss, granite, limestone,
sandstone, basalt or porphyry. Among such boulder
taluses the phenomenon designated as <i>Windröhren</i>
or <i>Ventarolen</i>, that is, windholes, is frequently found.
Sometimes the air among such boulder formations is
quiet, but as a general thing draughts pour out at the
lower openings during the hot months, and blow into
them during the cold ones.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Freezing Wells, Mines and Tunnels.</i>&mdash;Subterranean
ice is also found in certain places in connection with
man&rsquo;s handiwork. In a few wells in the United States,
the temperature in winter becomes abnormally low, and
for four or five months these wells freeze up and become
useless. A case of a freezing well was recently observed
near la Ferté Milon in Central France.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Ice is
reported also as forming in various mines in Europe,
Asia and America; in fact, it is not an uncommon occurrence.
Occasionally, also, ice forms in tunnels.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> See Part I.: pages <a href="#Page_74">74</a>, <a href="#Page_79">79</a>, <a href="#Page_89">89</a>. Part III.: <a href="#Page_206">page 206</a>.</p></div>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Cold Caves.</i>&mdash;Caves with abnormally low temperatures
may be divided into two classes. First, caves where the
temperatures are lower than the normal, without becoming
low enough for ice to form; and second, caves
where the temperatures sink so low, that ice forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span></p>

<p>Caves where the temperatures sink below the normal,
but in which ice does not form either in winter or in
summer, are found in several places in different parts of
the world. They are termed in French <i>cavernes froides</i>
and in German <i>kalte höhlen</i>. There are but few data
from reliable observers about such cold caves. Some
descriptions are given without thermometric measurements,
and the statements that the caves are cold, mean
nothing beyond the fact that they feel colder than the
outside air. It is, however, conclusively proved that cold
caves exist, and that while they are not freezing caverns,
yet that they have a temperature lower than the mean
annual temperature of their district. In fact, the assumption,
which had passed into an axiom, that caves always
have the same temperatures as the mean annual temperature
of the district, must certainly be given up. Cold
caves are generally in one of two shapes: 1, in the shape
of a sand glass,&mdash;two cones above each other meeting
at the narrowest point&mdash;where the upper cone lets the
heavy cold air descend easily, while the lower bell shaped
cone prevents its escape; and 2, where two sink holes
open into one pit, which is in the shape of a bell.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> <i>Les Abimes</i>, page 563.</p></div>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Glacière Caves or Freezing Caves.</i>&mdash;Caves where the
temperatures sink so low that ice is able to form, are
found in many different rock formations and in various
positions, shapes and sizes. The rock formation of freezing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
caverns is generally limestone, but sometimes it is
marble, lava, basalt, gneiss or granite. In all cases, however,
the rock is either porous or else it is broken and
fissured, as otherwise the water supply necessary to the
formation of ice could not find its way in.</p>

<p>Glacière caverns may, for the sake of convenience,
be classified into several classes, according to their position
or to their form. The lines of transition between
them, however, are so indefinite in nature, that it is often
difficult to specify a cavern as belonging to any special
type. The most important factor in classifying glacière
caves is their position. Under this head there are two
main divisions: first, pit caves; second, cliff caves.</p>

<p>Pit caves are those where a pit or pits open into the
ground, and the ice is found at the bottom. Sometimes
there is no roof, when the place may be called a gorge:
this occurs at Ellenville, where the roof has fallen.
Again, the pit itself is more or less roofed over and
the ice is found mainly or wholly under the roof: this
is the case at Haut d&rsquo;Aviernoz, at the Friedrichsteinerhöhle,
at Saint-Livres, and at Saint-Georges. Sometimes
the pit takes the form of a descending tunnel, leading
into a hall or chamber, in which the ice lies under a
rock roof: this happens at Chaux-les-Passavant. In
all these pit caves the body of the cave is below the
entrance, and most of them are fairly well lighted by
daylight throughout. Generally there is only one pit,
but occasionally there are two connected underground,
as is the case at La Genollière.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span></p>

<p>Cliff caves are those where the entrance is at the
base or in the side of a cliff. Frequently the cave is in
the shape of a hall or chamber, which begins directly at
the entrance, and which may be large or small. This
kind always has a down slope directly from the mouth.
The Kolowratshöhle, Dóbsina and the Grand Cave de
Montarquis may be mentioned as examples. In some
cases there is a pit at the base of a cliff and there is
a slope leading down to the cave, somewhat in the form
of a tunnel: this is the case at Manchester and practically
also at Roth. Again there is a more or less long
gallery between the entrance and the glacière, which
is always below the level of the entrance. The Schafloch,
Démenyfálva and Decorah may be cited as examples.
As a rule the gallery slopes down from the
entrance, but sometimes the floor rises and then sinks
to the glacière. The top of the entrance, however, is
always higher than the highest point of the floor, as
otherwise the cold air could not get in. This is the
case at the Frauenmauerhöhle, and, apparently, also at
the Posselthöhle. In one case, at Amarnath in Kashmere,
the floor is said to rise to the roof at the back;
but as the entrance is nearly as big as the floor area,
the ice formations must also be below the level of the
top of the entrance.</p>

<p>The dimensions of glacière caves vary greatly. Some
are large, others are small. Saint Georges, a roofed pit
cave, is some twenty-five meters by twelve meters, with
a depth of about twelve meters. Chaux-les-Passavant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">« 121 »</a></span>
a cave at the end of a pit tunnel, has a diameter of
some twenty-seven meters. The measures of Dóbsina,
a cave at the bottom of a cliff, are given as follows:
Height of roof above ice floor, 10 to 11 meters; length
120 meters; breadth, 35 to 60 meters, and surface
about 4644 meters. The Frauenmauerhöhle is a gallery
about one hundred meters long before the ice floor is
reached, and this is some fifty meters more in length by
about seven meters in width. The glacière cave near
Frain, on the contrary, is so small that one can only
crawl in some two or three meters. In fact, glacière
caves vary in size between great halls and little tunnels
where one cannot stand up straight.</p>

<p>The entrances of glacière caves also vary greatly in
their dimensions. For instance, the Friedrichsteinerhöhle
is on one side of a huge pit and is as large and deep as
the pit. Saint Georges, on the contrary, has, near one
end of the roof, a couple of holes, some three meters in
diameter. The entrance to the Schafloch is four meters
wide by four meters seventy centimeters high, while the
entrance to Roth is not over one meter each way.</p>

<p>A classification of subterranean ice formations, and
one which applies to all the different forms, is into permanent
and periodic glacières. When in any underground
spot, ice remains throughout the year, the place may be
called a permanent glacière; when on the contrary the ice
melts away for part of the year, the place may be called
a periodic glacière. This classification, which several observers
have used already, is convenient and valuable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span></p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Movements of Air.</i>&mdash;Another classification of glacières
can be made in accordance with the movements of air
underground. Glacières may be divided into those where
there are no strong draughts in summer and those where
there are draughts: or into &ldquo;apparently static caves&rdquo;;
and &ldquo;dynamic caves&rdquo; or &ldquo;windholes.&rdquo; The first class
includes those caves where there is one or more openings
close together and those above the body of the
cave. In such hollows the air in summer is nearly still,
while in winter there are distinct rotary movements of
the air as soon as the temperature outside is lower than
that within. Almost all glacière caves belong to this
class of caves without strong draughts in summer. Sometimes,
however, ice is found in hollows where there are
two or more openings, at different altitudes and at different
ends of the hollow, and where there are draughts.
Occasionally, also, there are fissures in the sides or rear
of apparently static caves, which allow something like
draughts at times, as is the case at the Grand Cave de
Montarquis.</p>

<p>Professor Thury of Geneva coined the terms &ldquo;static
cave&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic cave&rdquo; which have come largely into
use since, and which practically correspond to the German
terms <i>eishöhle</i> and <i>windröhre</i>. I do not think the term
&ldquo;static cave&rdquo; accurate, and prefer the term &ldquo;apparently
static cave&rdquo; or &ldquo;cave without distinct draughts.&rdquo; For although
there are many caves where the air seems stagnant
at times, and there are no distinct perceptible draughts,
still that the air is really stagnant all summer appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
me doubtful, and it seems as if the movements of
air were distinctly apparent only in certain caves and
not in others. Air which is apparently stagnant is
found in both pit and cliff caves mainly in the summer
months, but even in these I have noticed several
times in summer slight movements of air, especially
near the entrance. I could not exactly feel the air
moving, but by lighting a cigar the smoke could be
seen borne outwards exceedingly slowly. At the entrance
of the Kolowratshöhle I think there was a faint
outward current when I was there. The day was hot
and windless, and as the cold air met the hot outside
air it formed a faint cloud or mist at the mouth of the
cavern. At Saint-Georges, although the air seemed tranquil,
I found that the smoke of my cigar ascended rapidly
just below the hole in the roof, showing an ascending
air current. In the double cave of Chapuis, I found
one cavern filled by a little lake over which there was a
draught.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> See Part IV.: Butler, page 308.</p></div>

<p>From the few winter observations we have, there can
be no doubt that in winter the movements of the atmosphere
are lively, the break in the air column occurring
as soon as the outside temperature is lower than that
within, when the outer air immediately begins to sink
into the cave.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>If I have doubts as to the existence of absolutely static
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
caves, it is different about dynamic caves. When a subterranean
hollow goes through rocks, with one opening
higher than the other, there will surely be distinct draughts.
These dynamic caves exist in many parts of the world
under such names as cold current caves or blowing caves
or windholes. Sometimes they are fissures in broken
limestone. Often they are the cracks between piles of
boulders. A cool air generally pours from the lower
opening in summer while the cold air pours into it in
winter, the draught being then reversed. At the upper
opening the operation takes place in the opposite way,
the hot air being sucked in in summer, and given out
in winter. Sometimes, however, changes take place, according
to the differences in the outside temperature, in the
direction of the air current in the course of a single day.</p>

<p>The causes of the movements of air in these windholes
are exceedingly simple. The movements of air
depend on the fact that in summer the air in the tube
becomes colder from contact with the rocks and, therefore,
heavier than the air outside, and by gravity the
heavy inside air displaces the lighter outside air and
comes rushing out at the lower opening. This leaves a
vacuum, which is filled by the warmer air dropping into
the tube from above. In winter on the contrary, the air
within the tube is warmed by contact with the rocks and
becomes lighter than the air outside. It, therefore, rises
and streams out from the upper opening, and the vacuum
is filled by the heavy cold air pushing in at the lower
opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span></p>

<p>G. F. Parrot&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> explanation is so satisfactory that I
give it with one or two changes. He considers the air
movements an ordinary statical phenomenon of the air,
in caves which have two openings at different altitudes.
Let E G D represent the section of such a cave with
the openings A and B. Let us think that there are over
C and B two vertical air columns and from B to C a
horizontal air column B C; then the two air columns over
B and C are at all times of the year equal in weight. Not
so the air columns A C and A E G D B, because their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
temperatures are different. Assume the temperature in
the cave G is +12&deg; the whole year round. If in summer
the air column A C is at a temperature of +25&deg;,
then the heavy air in the cave G pours out through A and
is replaced by air flowing in through B. If in winter the
air column A C is at a temperature of -1&deg;, then the
air pours with equal inverse velocity at A into the cave,
and out at B. The velocity of the current in both cases
depends on the difference of temperature within and
without.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The foregoing explanation makes it evident that the
movements of air in these windholes do not depend on
the presence of ice. In many of those I have examined
myself there was no ice visible, and from the temperature
of the air current, there could not have been any
ice within the mountain. Still, there are numerous cases
where ice is found in windholes among boulders, and
a few cases where windholes exist in connection with
apparently static glacière caves. Undoubtedly the great
majority of windholes do not contain ice in summer, or,
indeed, at any time of the year, and, as far as I can see,
windholes, according to their temperatures, belong rather
to the class of normal caves than to that of glacières.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Forms of Ice.</i>&mdash;Almost all the forms assumed by underground
ice are different from those assumed by overground
ice. This is not surprising, as the conditions,
under which the ice is formed, are so different. Almost
all the lines of underground ice are rounded. The sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span>
angles and fractures visible on glacier or iceberg are
absent. Instead of seracs and crevasses, broken ice falls,
or piled up ice floes, we have hanging stalactites and rising
stalagmites, smooth ice floors and curved ice slopes.
This difference is of course due to the fact that most
subterranean ice is formed from the drip from the roof
or the sides of caves, and because the factor of motion&mdash;which
plays so large a part in the shaping by
fracture of overground ice&mdash;is practically wanting.</p>

<p>The most striking forms of subterranean ice are the
ice stalactites and stalagmites. They descend from the
roof as icicles or rise from it as rough cones or pyramids.
The icicles are of all sorts of shapes and sizes:
sometimes they are tiny; sometimes they grow downward
till they reach the floor and form regular columns,
in some cases no less than eleven meters in height.</p>

<p>The ice stalagmites likewise are of all sorts of shapes
and sizes, some of them growing to a height of seven
or eight meters. Occasionally they have hollow bases,
but this is rare. How these hollow cones are formed is
a still uncertain matter; but it is in some way by the
action of the drip. At the Kolowratshöhle I saw the drip
from the roof cutting out in July the basin, whose tall remaining
sides suggested that early in the spring it was
probably a hollow cone. The cone at the Schafloch of
which I saw one half remaining, could only be accounted
for by some action from the drip.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The warmth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
rock floor may help perhaps also, in melting away some
of the base of the hollow columns.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> See Part IV.: Thury, <a href="#Page_287">page 287</a>; Browne, <a href="#Page_290">page 290</a>.</p></div>

<p>The frozen waterfalls which issue from fissures in
the rock walls of caves are another form of ice seen
only below ground. For lack of a better name, I call
them fissure columns. A peculiarity of these is that,
while the rock fissure is more or less rectangular or at
least sharp angled, the ice column issues in a rounded
stream. Sometimes these fissure columns stream over
the rock; sometimes they spring out far enough from
the rock to be quite away from it. They vary from
about one to five meters in height, and at the base
they almost always spread out in a shape resembling
that of a fan.</p>

<p>The ice on the bottom of caverns of course takes its
shape from the form and angles of the floor of the caves.
If the bottom is level or nearly so, the ice lies on it as
a sheet or floor. If the bottom of the cave is sloping, the
ice follows the angles of the slope, forming an ice slope
or ice wall, and sometimes becoming nearly or quite
vertical. These ice slopes distantly resemble the portions
of glaciers called an ice fall, with the great difference,
however, that there are no crevasses, not even
tiny ones.</p>

<p>Occasionally, slabs of ice are found reposing in a
fractured sheet over a solid ice floor. This means
that a lake has formed on this spot in the spring, frozen
over, and then run off, leaving its frozen surface in
broken pieces on top of the under ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span></p>

<p>Another kind of frozen water is the hoar frost which
forms on the rock roofs and walls. This is not at all
rare. It is an open question whether this is not the
same thing as that which has been described as subterranean
snow.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I found myself in Dóbsina a small sheet of
what to look and touch was snow. I wrote of this as
snow in my first paper about glacières<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, but I am of
the opinion now that it was the hoar frost detached
from the roof and not genuine snow.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> See Part III.: Ziegenloch, <a href="#Page_247">page 247</a>; Creux de Souci, <a href="#Page_207">page 207</a>.</p></div>

and March, 1897.</p></div>

<p>At Dóbsina, also, I noticed that the ice of the ice
wall of the Korridor assumed a stratified or laminated
form. Mr. John F. Lewis of Philadelphia suggested to
me that this was probably due to a precipitation of the
hoar frost from the roof, and I think his explanation is
correct. The hoar frost forming at a certain degree of
cold, would doubtless be precipitated at a rise of temperature,
and would then act much as do the different
layers of snow in the upper portion of glaciers.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It
would consolidate gradually, layer over layer, and form
strata, producing the banded or laminated structure
visible in the vertical ice of the Dóbsina Korridor.</p>

<p>The ice in caverns is sometimes found with a
structure which is, I believe, of rare occurrence above
ground. This is when it takes the shape known as
prismatic ice, which means that if a lump is broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">« 130 »</a></span>
from a column or icicle, the fracture will show regular
prisms. This phenomenon is not as yet satisfactorily
accounted for; the only thing certain about it is, that it
does not occur in ice of recent formation. From my
own observations, I should say that ice became prismatic
at the end of summer; at least I have always found it
in August or September rather than in June or July.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Besides building up ice heaps, the drip, also, has the
function of destroying its own creations. If there are
no crevasses, there are holes and runnels. These are
generally found at or leading to the lowest point of the
ice floor. Occasionally the holes are deep, sometimes
many meters in depth. They are certainly cut out by
the melting water, to which they offer an exit; in fact
they are a part of the drainage system present in all glacière
caves, where there must be some outlet for surplus
water at or near the lowest point: and as the
caves are always in porous or broken rock, the drainage
takes place through the cracks and fissures.</p>

<p>The drip produces also the exact opposite of pyramids
in the shape of ice basins. These are cut in the
floor by an extra strong drip from the roof at those
spots. Basins exactly like these are not seen on glaciers.
Not infrequently they are full of water of considerable
depth.</p>

<p>Lakes and pools are found in glacière caves. Sometimes
they are on the ice floor, and in this case they
are due either to rain-water collecting faster than it can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span>
flow off, or else because the cave is in a state of thaw.
Sometimes these pools are among the rocks in one part
of a cave, while the ice is in another part.</p>

<p>I have said above that motion in subterranean ice is
practically wanting. This is proved by the lack of crevasses
on the ice slopes or ice walls, and also by the
fact that basins and cones appear year after year in the
same spots, where they remain whether they are increasing
or diminishing. But this statement cannot be held
to cover the entrance snow and ice slopes of some of
the open pit caves such as the Gottscheer cave, or Saint-Livres
or Haut d&rsquo;Aviernoz. Here the snow, which falls
on the entrance slope, must gradually gravitate to the
bottom. The question is whether it only descends in the
shape of water after melting or as snow before solidifying;
or whether it ever slides down at all after becoming somewhat
solidified. Probably, however, the ice of these slopes,
judging from the fact that crevasses are entirely lacking,
remains stationary.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Color Effects.</i>&mdash;The color effect of every glacière
cavern has a certain individuality, according to the color
of the rocks, the quantity of ice, and the amount of
daylight admitted through the entrance. In my opinion,
the white note given by the ice, makes a fine glacière
cave the most beautiful of all subterranean hollows.
In this respect it seems to me that they are similar to
high Alps, which are certainly most impressive with coverings
of snow and glacier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">« 132 »</a></span></p>

<p>There are, however, two distinct notes in the color
effects of glacière caves and these may be described as
the partly subterranean, or as the wholly subterranean.
In the former case the local tints stand out more clearly.
For instance, at the Kolowratshöhle the ice is beautifully
transparent and of a pale ochre-greenish hue: the limestone
rocks are streaked with iron, and thus have a reddish
hue, while, owing to the entrance admitting plenty
of daylight, the effect is only semi-subterranean. Again,
at Chaux-les-Passavant plenty of daylight is admitted:
the rocks are a yellowish brown, and the ice is white
and blue. At the Schafloch or the Frauenmauer, on
the contrary, the effect is wholly subterranean: daylight
is so completely absent that black is the predominating
note, the ice itself looking gray. Dóbsina is an exception,
as, thanks to the electric light, white is the conspicuous
tone, even though rocks and shadows dull many
places and corners into a sombre gray.</p>

<p>More than once, on returning to daylight from the intense
blackness of a cave, I have seen the rocks near the
entrance appear a dark blue color, exactly simulating
moonlight. This effect is common to both glacière caves
and ordinary caverns. It is a striking but rare phenomenon,
and depends apparently on the shape of the
cave. This moonlight effect only seems to occur when
a cave makes an elbow directly after the mouth and
then goes straight for some distance. When the daylight
is actually in sight, the moonlight impression vanishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span></p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Carbonic Acid Gas.</i>&mdash;Carbonic acid gas, judging from
the most recent explorations, is more of a rarity in rock
caves with normal temperatures than is generally supposed.
There appears to be only one case on record where this
gas was observed in a cold cave. This was in the
Creux-de-Souci,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> which is rather a cold than a freezing
cavern, but which on one occasion was found to contain
snow, and whose temperature is always extremely low.
From the present state of knowledge, therefore, it may
be assumed that if carbonic acid gas does form in glacière
caves, it does so only seldom.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;No attention whatever has been paid, practically
as yet, as to whether any distinctive animal life
exists in glacières. So far, I have seen none myself.
The Rev. G. F. Browne, in four instances, found a large
red-brown fly nearly an inch long, which is supposed to
be <i>Stenophylax Hieroglyphicus</i> of Stephens; and at Chapuis,
he obtained an ichneumon of the genus <i>Paniscus</i>.
At Font d&rsquo;Urle, Monsieur Villard captured a blind specimen
of a coleoptera, <i>Cytodromus dapsoïdes</i>. A variety
of rotifer, <i>Notholca longispina</i>, is now living in the Creux-de-Souci.
In Skerisora, remains of bats have been
found, not very different from those now living in the
neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It is, in any case, certainly remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">« 134 »</a></span>
that the same kind of fly should have been discovered
in several glacières in different localities; and it may
some day be shown that there is a special insect fauna.
Certainly the subject is worth investigating.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;The flora of glacières has been as little observed
as the fauna. There are scarcely any references to
such a thing as glacière plant life in literature. Whether
there is a special flora in any glacière cave is still an
open question. In the cases of several boulder taluses,
there is no doubt that, even if there is not a special
flora, at least that the plants near the ice beds are
greatly retarded every year in their development. Probably
the flora among the boulders blooms a month or six
weeks later than the flora in the immediate vicinity. In
the cases of the Cave of Paradana and of the Kuntschner
Eishöhle it is reported that the plant life becomes more
and more arctic in character towards the bottom of the
pit.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

of Yeermallik in Kondooz,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> anything which reveals the
presence of man in glacières or that they were ever used
for habitation. The reason that there are so few remains
in glacière caves is undoubtedly because their temperatures
are too low for their occupation by animal or man; but,
from the evidence afforded by their non-occupation, may
be drawn the valuable inference that the glacière caves
of to-day were glacière caves long ago.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II.</a></h2>


<p>The cause of the formation of subterranean ice is undoubtedly
one of the most intricate problems in connection
with caverns. Various theories have been advanced
why ice is found in certain caves and not in others. Some
writers have held that it is a remnant of a glacial period;
others that it is owing to the presence of salts in the rocks;
some have said that it is due to the rocks retarding waves
of heat and cold; and still others think that it is formed by
pressure on the percolating waters. Many of these theories
were formulated in explanation of the belief of peasants
living near the caves, who almost always say that
the ice is formed in summer and melts in winter. Most
scientific observers on the other hand claim that the
ice is due to the cold of winter, and a few think that
it is formed or helped by draughts and by evaporation
and expansion of the air. The variety of opinions put
forth, show at any rate the intricacy of the problem.</p>

<p>All my own observations have tended more and more
to make me believe that the cold of winter is the cause
of the ice. Before elaborating my own views, however,
I wish to take up seriatim the theories which have been
formulated, principally in explanation of the belief that
the ice was a summer product, and to give my reasons
for my disbelief in them.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Glacial Period.</i>&mdash;The first theory, perhaps, to touch
on, is the one that the ice is a remnant of a glacial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
period. This seems to occur to many persons as a solution
of the question when they first hear of glacières,
and it has been several times propounded to me, and
naturally enough, always by scientific men.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Still I do
not think it has ever been held by anyone who had
made a study of glacières.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> See Part IV.: Hitchcock, <a href="#Page_284">page 284</a>; Bonney, <a href="#Page_291">page 291</a>; Dawkins,
<a href="#Page_292">page 292</a>.</p></div>

<p>The theory is, indeed, untenable in regard to freezing
caves, as it does not accord with the observed facts of the
yearly disappearance of the ice in many caves and taluses.
At Szilize every year the ice has disappeared pretty completely
by November, and the cave is free; but in
April or May the floor is again covered with ice, and
columns and icicles have formed on the roof and sides.
At La Genollière the cave is used by the people of the
neighboring châlets, through the spring and early summer,
to help in the operation of butter making; by the
middle or the end of August it has entirely disappeared,
but is found formed afresh the following spring. At the
Rumney Talus, at the Cave of Decorah, at the Gorge
of Ellenville, and at the Williamstown Snow Hole, I
found no snow or ice.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Yet it is abundant in all these
localities in the spring. Too many examples of the complete
melting away of the ice every year can be cited,
to permit any doubt: glacière caves are not connected
with a glacial period.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>Though it may be stated positively that the ice in
caves is not a remnant of a glacial period, yet this cannot
be done so authoritatively about subsoil ice sheets
and freezing wells. At Brandon, Owego and Decorah
the gravel was found frozen at the time the wells were
dug, and it is of course impossible to determine for how
long a time this was the case previous to the digging.
The proofs, however, are so strong that the ice re-forms
every winter at such freezing wells, that they may be
considered as in every respect following the same general
laws as glacière caves. That the ice in these wells
is not the remains of a glacial period, seems proved
moreover by the work of the Boston Natural History
Society, which sank two wells at Brandon near to the
Freezing well. One of these was only twenty-one meters
distant and went through the same gravel drift. Yet it
did not strike ice.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> A somewhat similar state of things
appears to be the case with the Centennial Lode and
other lodes on Mount McClellan,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> where the causes also
seem to be local, as there is no ice in mines on neighboring
mountains.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>The Summer&rsquo;s Heat Theory.</i>&mdash;The natives and peasants
in the neighborhood of glacière caves generally believe
that the ice of caves is formed in summer and melts in
winter. I have met with this belief everywhere in Europe;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">« 139 »</a></span>
in the Eifel, Jura, Swiss Alps, Tyrolese Alps, and
Carpathians: and also occasionally in the United States.
Peasants and guides tell you with absolute confidence:
&ldquo;The hotter the summer the more ice there is.&rdquo; The
strange thing is that any number of writers<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>&mdash;sometimes
scientific men&mdash;have accepted the ideas and statements
of the peasants about the formation of ice in summer,
and have tried to account for it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Among them may be mentioned: Boisot, 1686; Valvasor, 1689;
Behrens, 1703; Billerez, 1712; Bel, 1739; Rosenmüller and Tillesius,
1799; Sartori, 1809; Pictet, 1822; Scrope, 1826; Murchison, 1845.</p></div>

<p>The belief of the peasants is founded on the fact that
they scarcely ever go to any cave except when some
tourist takes them with him, and, therefore, they rarely
see one in winter, and their faith is not based on observation.
It is, however, founded on an appearance of
truth: and that is on the fact that the temperatures of
glacière caves, like that of other caves or that of cellars,
are colder in summer than the outside air, and warmer in
winter than the outside air. Possessing neither reasoning
powers nor thermometers, the peasants simply go a
step further and say that glacière caves are cold in summer
and hot in winter.</p>

<p>Professor Thury tells a story to the point. He visited
the Grand Cave de Montarquis in mid-winter. All
the peasants told him there would be no use going, as
there would be no ice in the cave. He tried to find
even one peasant who had been to the cave in winter,
but could not. He then visited it himself and found it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
full of hard ice. On his return he told the peasants of
his discovery. They were staggered at first, finally one
exclaimed: &ldquo;It makes no difference; in genuine glacières
there is no ice in winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be difficult, probably, to eradicate this belief and
the consequent theories among the uneducated people in
the vicinity of glacière caves, for their imperfect observations
will keep it alive. In refutation, it may be said
that the winter&rsquo;s cold theory is the direct opposite of the
summer&rsquo;s heat theory, and that all the observations and
all the facts which prove the one, disprove the other.</p>

<p>Within two or three years, however, the formation of
small quantities of ice has been observed during the
summer months in one or two caves. This has taken
place in mountain caves situated at a high altitude at
times when the air outside has dropped below freezing
point during the night. There is, therefore, nothing inconsistent
in this fact with the winter&rsquo;s cold theory:
indeed it is only a widening of it in the meaning of the
word winter.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

Cranmer, <a href="#Page_310">page 310</a>.</p></div>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Chemical Causes.</i>&mdash;Non-scientific persons, on first hearing
of glacière caves, almost always suggest that to form
the ice there must be salts in the rocks. Probably they
connect unconsciously in their minds &ldquo;ice caves&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ice cream.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span></p>

<p>Chemical causes, however, have never appealed to
scientific men.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> There are only two places I know of
where salt is reported. One is the Ice Spring in Oregon,
which is said to be slightly saline in taste; the
other is the Cave of Illetzkaya-Zatschita, where the gypsum
hillock, in which the ice is found, overlies a bed
of rock salt. Repeated experiments in letting lumps of
glacière ice melt in my mouth have convinced me personally
that in all cases the water is exceedingly pure
and sweet, a fact mentioned in the very first notice extant
about glacières, the letter of Benigne Poissenot in
1586, who speaks of the deliciousness of the water in
Chaux-les-Passavant. To sum this matter up briefly, it
can be safely asserted that all causes, which would fall
under the head of &ldquo;Chemical causes,&rdquo; must be entirely
eliminated as possible cold producers.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Waves of Heat and Cold.</i>&mdash;While Sir Roderick Murchison
was studying the geology of Russia,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> he visited
Illetzkaya-Zatschita and was puzzled to account for the
ice formations. He thought, at first, that they were due
to the presence of salt, but recognizing that this was not
correct he submitted the case to Sir John Herschel, who,
rejecting the evaporation or condensation of vapor as the
cause, argued that the ice was due to waves of heat and
cold, and that at certain depths in the interior, the cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">« 142 »</a></span>
wave arrived in mid-summer and the heat in mid-winter.
Murchison declined to assent to this doctrine, asking
why one cave should present this exceptional occurrence,
when the numerous other rents and openings in the same
hillock were free from ice. The impossibility of the heat
and cold wave theory was so completely shown by Murchison&rsquo;s
objection, that it has never again been brought
forward.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Capillary or Compressed Air Theory.</i>&mdash;The possibility
of compressed air causing subterranean ice to form
seems to have been first authoritatively formulated by Mr.
N. M. Lowe, of Boston.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> His theory in brief is this:&mdash;Bubbles
of air drawn into water flowing down through
fissures in rocks are liable to a continually increasing
pressure. When the air has reached the bottom and
is liberated in the cave, it will be from a pressure
equal to the height of the column of water, and it will
have lost by connection in the mass through which the
conduit passes, the heat due to its compression; and on
being liberated, it will immediately absorb from the air
and the water in the cave, the heat which it has lost in
its downward passage.</p>

Silliman, <a href="#Page_279">page 279</a>; Olmstead, <a href="#Page_282">page 282</a>.</p></div>

<p>Several scientific observers have rallied to this idea.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
One of the Hungarian residents at Dóbsina, a doctor,
whose opportunities for observations are unrivalled, told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">« 143 »</a></span>
me&mdash;if I understood him correctly&mdash;that he believed in
the capillary theory.</p>

<p>There are many facts, however, which militate against
the compressed air theory as applied to caves. Almost
all caves receive some drip through fissures, and yet
there are many thousands of caves which never contain
ice, and whose temperature scarcely varies the year round.
Especially against the theory is the fact that glacière caves
are never known in hot countries. If the theory were
correct we should, for instance, sometimes find ice in such
caves as those of Yucatan described by Mr. Mercer.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> <i>The Hill Caves of Yucatan.</i></p></div>

<p>There are also some mechanical difficulties in the
way. Mr. John Ritchie<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> touches them when he says:
&ldquo;If the passage through which the water flows down is
at all tubular the column will be subjected to the usual
hydrostatic pressure.&rdquo; The word <i>tubular</i> is the hard
one to answer. Limestone rock fissures are certainly
not tubular. They have all sorts of shapes and angles
and corners, every one of which would interfere with
anything like a regular pressure.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> <i>Boston Transcript</i>, January 2d, 1897.</p></div>

<p>This latter objection would not apply to borings in
mines. I have been assured that in some borings in
Western mines ice has been formed by pressure, and
there may be truth in this, although I doubt it, as I have
yet to hear of ice in any mines in warm latitudes. Mr.
John Ritchie<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> has suggested, also, that if compressed air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">« 144 »</a></span>
does not perhaps act strongly enough to form ice, yet it
may help in keeping the temperature low and aid in the
formation of draughts in caves and boulder heaps. At
present, however, I can see no reason to think that the
ice in caves is due to compressed air.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III.</a></h2>


<p>I have already said that I believe that the cold of
winter is the cause of the ice in caves. To make
this clearer, I may say that I look on glacières as the
last outcrop, the outside edge, so to speak, of the area
of low temperatures, which has its culminating point in
the Northern Hemisphere in the Arctic Ocean, Greenland
and Siberia, and in the Southern Hemisphere in the Antarctic;
and which is manifested to us in the snows of
mountain peaks, and immediately round us in frozen ponds
and rivers and snowy blizzards; and which, as it disappears
each summer, leaves its last traces in our latitudes
in sequestered gorges and convenient caverns. In every
case, it seems to me, glacières are simply refrigerators,
which preserve the ice and snow accumulated in them
during the winter. They all follow the same general laws
as to the origin of their contents, modified only in slight
degree according to the varying natural local conditions,
such as the water supply, or the protection from
sun and wind, or the thickness of the overhead rock, or
the altitude or latitude. I cannot see that there is anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
remarkable about the fact that the cold of winter
is able to penetrate and make itself felt sometimes for
a slight depth in the earth&rsquo;s crust; a depth, so far as
yet known, never exceeding one hundred and fifty meters.
It seems to me that glacières only emphasize a law
of nature, which has doubtless been formulated many
times in connection with springs and phreatic waters,
and that is, that where we find cold waters underground,
we may be sure that they have penetrated from the
outside.</p>

<p>If we look first at the mode of formation of overground
perennial ice, that is, of the ice of glaciers and of
rock gorges; and then at the evidences of the mode
of formation of underground perennial ice, in boulder
heaps, wells and caves; we will soon see that the transitions
between them are gentle in character and that
there is nothing unnatural about the formation of the
ice in glacières.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Glaciers.</i>&mdash;Everyone now knows the main characteristics
of glaciers. They are formed in parts of the
earth where the land or the mountains reach to the
region of perpetual snow. The snows fall from the
sky, and accumulate into a snow cap, which by its own
weight and by melting and regelation, gradually changes
to ice. This, by the laws of gravitation, descends to
lower levels, and in mountain valleys extends sometimes
far below the snow line into the region of cultivated
fields. These valley prolongations of the perpetual snow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span>
caps are the glaciers. The important point to notice
here, is that the formation of glaciers is originally entirely
due to the precipitation of moisture by cold in the
upper portions; while the destruction of glaciers is due
to the action of heat melting the ice in the lower portions,
where they disappear in the shape of streams of
running water. It is, therefore, not surprising that the
greatest glaciers are found in the Arctic and Antarctic
regions and in the highest mountain ranges; and that
in the tropics glaciers are either wanting or exceedingly
small.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Gorges and Troughs.</i>&mdash;Gorges and gullies, where ice
remains over, are a transitional form between glaciers and
glacières. In many mountain ravines or canyons, the
enduring snow consists principally of the avalanches
which have fallen from the heights above during the
winter and solidified in the bottom of the ravines.
Freezing gorges proper, however, are not dependent
on avalanches for their supply, but they receive the
accretions to their ice directly from the winter snows.
These fall into the gorge itself and by melting and regelation
gradually solidify into a mass of ice which, when
well sheltered against sun and wind, remains over sometimes
till the following winter. By their mode of formation,
therefore, it is evident that the ice in these gorges
has some of the characteristics of glaciers; that it is due
to the same prime causes as the ice of glaciers or the ice
on ponds and rivers, namely the cold of winter; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
fact, it is not far wrong to consider these gorges as
miniature glaciers.</p>

<p>Freezing gorges, however, show, also, certain degrees
of kinship to freezing caverns and taluses, principally in
the protection afforded to the ice against external destructive
influences. The ice is almost always found in
positions where it receives little, if any, of the direct
rays of the sun and, also, where it is scarcely, if at all,
exposed to any winds. The sides of the fissures and
surrounding trees generally afford the necessary protection.
Some of the forms which the ice assumes in
gorges, such as long pendent icicles, are also more characteristic
of underground than of overground ice.</p>

<p>The freezing troughs or basins found in Siberia are
evidently closely related to gorges, and the fact that the
ice is found in less sheltered places may be explained
by the high northerly latitudes of these troughs, in general
between fifty-seven and sixty degrees.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>The Winter&rsquo;s Cold Theory.</i>&mdash;The places where ice is
found underground differ in one important respect from
gullies and troughs, and that is, in the fact that above
the ice there is rock or soil, which, in true caves, takes
the form of a roof. This causes some important distinctions
between overground and underground perennial
ice. It means that the ice is formed directly in the caves,
and that it is genuine subterranean ice, and not, except
perhaps near the entrance, solidified snow. The roof,
while not admitting the winter snows, is, however, a protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
against warm summer rains, and, of course, entirely
cuts off radiation from the sky. If, therefore, it keeps
out some cold, it also acts as a protector against heat.</p>

<p>That the cold of winter is the source of the cold which
produces the ice which forms underground, and that it
is through its influence, with the assistance of certain
secondary causes, that some caves are converted into
what are practically natural ice houses, seems to me the
true explanation of the phenomenon of subterranean ice,
not only since it is the simple and obvious explanation,
but also because all the facts, so far as I have myself
observed, are in accord with this theory.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>To form subterranean ice, just as to form any other ice,
two things are necessary: the first is cold, the second is
water. Cold is supplied by the cold air of winter, and
water must in some manner find its way into the cave
while the cold air is there.</p>

<p>The process is as follows: The cold air of winter
sinks into and permeates the cave, and in course of time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span>
freezes up all the water which, in the shape of melting
snow or cold winter rain or spring water, finds its way
in; and once ice is formed it remains long after ice in
the surrounding open country has melted away, because
heat penetrates with difficulty into the cave. The only
effect of the heat of summer is to melt the ice.</p>

<p>The proofs, to my mind, of the truth of this view are:
1&mdash;Glacières are always found in parts of the world
where, during part of the year at least, the temperatures
of the surrounding country fall below freezing point. 2&mdash;All
observations by reliable observers show that the
temperatures of glacière caves vary, but in a much narrower
thermometric scale, with those of the outside air:
that the temperatures are lowest, and as a rule below
freezing point, during the winter months; and that the
temperatures are highest, and as a rule above freezing
point, during the summer months. 3&mdash;Ice is never found
far from the mouth of caves, but always near enough
for the cold air to get in. 4&mdash;Evaporation, according to
my observations, is, as in all other forms of ice in nature,
connected mainly with the melting, not the freezing of
the ice.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Geographical Distribution and Altitudes.</i>&mdash;Glacière
caves proper are found in various parts of Europe,
Asia, and America, mostly in the smaller mountain
ranges or in the outliers of the snowy mountain
chains; generally in limestone and occasionally in basaltic
formations. There are a good many in the Jura; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span>
few in the Swiss and the Italian Alps; a number in the
Eastern Alps of Tyrol and Carinthia. There are some
in Hungary, several in Russia, one in Iceland, one on the
Peak of Teneriffe, a number in Siberia, one in Kondooz
in Central Asia, one in the Himálaya, one in Japan, and
one in Korea. I have heard so far of over fifty glacières
in North America, several of which are in Pennsylvania.
From all over the world there are some three hundred
places reported where subterranean ice is said to occur.
This includes gorges, boulder heaps and freezing mines
and wells, all of which exist in much the same localities
as glacière caves.</p>

<p>All the glacières which I know of, are situated in a
latitude or at an altitude where ice and snow forms for
part of the year in the surrounding open country. None
are reported from India or Africa, or in fact from any
low-lying places in tropical latitudes. Most of them are
found in middle latitudes, and only where during part
of the year, at least, there is a cold season, that is, where
for some time the thermometer stands below freezing
point.</p>

<p>Glacières are, in general, at fairly high altitudes. The
Schafloch is at 1780 meters; Skerisora in Transylvania
at 1127 meters; Dóbsina at 1100 meters; the Glacière
de Saint-Georges at 1208 meters. It is true that there
is one freezing cavern in the sub-tropical latitude of Teneriffe,
La Cueva de la Nieve; but it is at an altitude of
3300 meters, and where snow falls every year in the
open on the Peak. Unless some freezing cave is hereafter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">« 151 »</a></span>
discovered in a region where there is no ice in the
open in winter, I do not see how the imperative necessity
of the cold air of winter for forming the supply of ice
can be controverted.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Thermometric Observations.</i>&mdash;That the cold air of winter
is the important factor in the production of cold is
proved, also, by the thermometric observations recorded
in various caves by different observers. They all tell
the same tale: that the temperatures vary with those of
the outside air, that they are lowest in winter and highest
in summer. I quote in the &ldquo;List of Glacières&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> a
few of those published; but there are many more, and
they all show the same general characteristics.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_57" id="Footnote_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> See Part III.: Decorah, <a href="#Page_178">page 178</a>; Chaux-les-Passavant, <a href="#Page_202">pages 203-5</a>;
La Poujade, <a href="#Page_208">page 208</a>; Montarquis, <a href="#Page_218">page 218</a>; Saint-Georges,
<a href="#Page_219">page 219</a>; Schafloch, <a href="#Page_223">page 223</a>; Kolowratshöhle, <a href="#Page_227">page 227</a>; Schellenberger
Eisgrotte, <a href="#Page_228">page 228</a>; Frain, <a href="#Page_252">page 252</a>; Dóbsina, <a href="#Page_253">page 253</a>; etc.</p></div>

<p>A comparison of all the figures recorded proves that,
as a rule&mdash;inside of glacière caves&mdash;from about the first
of November to the first of July, there are winter temperatures,
that is temperatures below freezing point; and
from about the first of July to the first of November,
there are summer temperatures, that is temperatures
above freezing point.</p>

<p>The observations prove also that the inner temperatures
vary less than the outer, that is that they range
within narrower limits. They also show that the inner
air is but slowly affected by the outer air when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span>
latter is above freezing point, the inner temperature
rising then only gradually. Per contra, when the outside
temperature drops quickly much below freezing point,
the inside temperature generally drops correspondingly
at once, proving that the cold air has sunk by its weight
into the cave. The observations also prove that the old
idea that the temperature of caves is the same throughout,
can no longer be considered correct. The observations
also appear to show, that the temperature of a
cave does not necessarily represent the mean annual
temperature of a surrounding district. Observation is
still entirely lacking on the mean annual temperature
of glacières, so that one cannot speak definitely about
the matter; but it seems likely that the mean annual
temperature of a glacière cave is lower than the isotherm
of its locality; and it seems more than probable that on
the same isotherm different glacière caves may have
different mean annual temperatures, varying with the
elements of size, quantity of ice, position of body of
cave and of entrance, water supply and other factors.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Ice near the Entrance of Caves and the Surface of the
Soil.</i>&mdash;An important proof that it is the cold air of winter
which forms the ice is the fact that the latter is always
found near the entrance of caves or near the surface
of the soil. It never extends far within. To the best
of my knowledge, ice has never been found two hundred
meters from the entrance nor at any depth beyond
one hundred and fifty meters. In all caves of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span>
great extent, the temperature far in is about the same
as that of the surrounding rock, and in all deep borings
the temperature increases with the depth and at great
depths the temperature becomes high. This nearness of
subterranean ice to the outside air is one of the best
proofs, that, paradoxical as the whole phenomenon appears
at first, yet in reality it is an extremely simple
matter.</p>

<p>The position of the entrance of a cave in relation
to the body of the cave is an important factor in permitting
the cold air to permeate and remain in the
cave. In all the caves or gullies I have examined myself,
the main mass of ice is well below the level of
the entrance, and even if the latter is sheltered against
the wind, it is not sheltered against the cold air of
winter. This is heavy, and by its own weight sinks
well down to the bottom, freezing up in course of
time all the moisture that may drip from the roof, or
that may come into the cave in the shape of melted
snow or cold winter rain. The summer air, which is
warm and, therefore, light, can only enter the cave
with great difficulty; and, as a rule, before it dislodges
the winter air and destroys the ice, another winter&rsquo;s
freeze reverses once more the conditions. These principles
seem to hold of every known glacière. It is true,
that at the Frauenmauer, the floor of the cavern rises
somewhat from the entrance; but the highest point of
the floor is still below the level of the top of the entrance,
so that the cold air can flow over the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
point without difficulty. The same appears to be the
case at the Posselthöhle; while at Amarnath in Kashmere,
where the floor is said to rise to the back wall,
the entrance is about as large as the area of the floor,
so that the ice must also be below the level of the top
of the entrance.</p>

<p>The position or situation of the entrance is important.
In almost all cases it has a northerly exposure,
and is sheltered against entering winds. If these two
conditions do not exist the ice supply surely suffers.
Sometimes the entrance is more or less tortuous. In
some cases it is protected by a fringe of trees. Still,
there is no absolute rule about entrances. The Friedrichsteinerhöhle
faces about due south, and at midday
in summer, the sun shines all the way down to the
ice floor, causing mists to form. In the Kolowratshöhle,
the entrance is badly sheltered against the wind and
this undoubtedly affects the supply in summer and causes
more rapid melting there than in some other cases.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> See Part III.: Decorah, <a href="#Page_178">page 178</a>.</p></div>

<p>Freezing boulder taluses invariably have the ice near
the surface, and probably it is never a dozen meters
distant from the open air. These taluses are one of
the strongest links in the chain of evidence proving the
winter&rsquo;s cold theory. The snow and ice on the surface
of the taluses and on the surface of the boulders in
gullies melts away, while it still lingers underneath the
boulders. It seems self-evident that the melting snow
water has run to the lowest level and there congealed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span>
and then remained because it was better sheltered than
the ice outside.</p>

<p>The subsoil ice of the tundras of Siberia and Alaska
is almost identical with the ice of boulder formations,
except that it extends under larger areas. It is the product
of a climate where there is a long, rigorous winter
and it is not surprising that the ice is found at
greater depths than in more southerly latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The
depth to which the ice extends is, of course, determined
by the depth to which the winter&rsquo;s cold can penetrate
the soil. There is no doubt that the causes of this ice
are local, that is, that it is due to the long prevailing
low temperatures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59" id="Footnote_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> See Part III.: Alaska, <a href="#Page_166">page 166</a>; Klondike, <a href="#Page_167">page 167</a>; Kowak
River, <a href="#Page_166">page 166</a>; Kotzebue Sound, <a href="#Page_166">page 166</a>.</p></div>

<p>The freezing wells of which the most conspicuous examples
are at Brandon, Owego, Decorah, and in Montana,
seem also due to local causes and the ice is never far
from the surface, that is, not over twenty meters; and
apparently also it forms above the water horizons which
supply the wells.</p>

<p>The ice sheet on Mount Etna<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> does not seem to
be at any great depth. It apparently had a different
origin from most subterranean ice masses, in that the
snow probably fell first and was then covered by a flow
of lava. It is, therefore, almost <i>sui generis</i> in its mode
of formation, unless there are similar sheets on other
volcanoes, which is probable in a country like Iceland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
and which is said to be the case in Tierra del Fuego,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
But the original cause of the ice sheet on Etna was the
same as all other subterranean ice masses, namely the
cold of winter.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><i>Evaporation and Movements of Air.</i>&mdash;The formation
of subterranean ice is sometimes assigned partly to evaporation
or to expansion of the air. The theory is an
old one, and both scientific and non-scientific men have
advanced it.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_62" id="Footnote_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> Among those who have written that evaporation is a factor in the
formation of subterranean ice, may be mentioned: Pictet, 1822; Scrope,
1827; Reich, 1834; Pleischl, 1841; Murchison, 1845; Olmstead,
1856; Hitchcock, 1861; White, 1870; Kirchhoff, 1876; Krauss,
1895.</p></div>

<p>I have already said that I believe it is the movements
of the air which cause a cave to be a glacière cave or a
normal cave. When they act in such a way as to permit
the cold air of winter to permeate a cave, we find low
temperatures and ice; when they do not, we find the
temperature about the same as that of the ground and
no ice.</p>

<p>That the ice is not formed in apparently static caves,
by movements of air producing evaporation, seems to
me proved by what I have noticed in regard to the atmosphere.
The dryness or moistness of the air within
a glacière cave is coincident with the state of freezing
or thawing of the cave. When I have visited a large cave
in June, everything was frozen tight, there were no drips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">« 157 »</a></span>
nor mushy ice, the air was relatively dry and the sensation
of cold not unpleasant. When I have visited a cave
in August, the ice was soft and mushy, water was dripping
from the roof, the atmosphere was moist, and the cold
penetrating. It seems to me that the facts go to show
that it is not evaporation which forms the ice, but the
melting of the ice which fills the cave with moisture. If
there are any draughts or movements of the atmosphere
when above freezing point, then their tendency is
to vaporize the ice.</p>

<p>The process of the formation of ice in relation to the
atmosphere is as follows: the cold air permeates the
cave and freezes up all the drip: the atmosphere becomes
dry: gradually warmer air gets in and the ice
begins to melt: then the atmosphere gets charged slowly
with the vapor of the melting ice. This process is the
exact opposite of the formation of ice by evaporation;
it is the atmosphere which is made humid by the vaporizing
of the ice, and by the drip. When the air is thoroughly
saturated with the vapor, being scarcely renewed
from outside and but a few degrees above freezing point,
it undoubtedly retards evaporation, acts like a blanket
and lessens the rate of melting of the ice.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> See Part IV.: Thury, <a href="#Page_285">page 285</a>; Fugger, <a href="#Page_296">page 296</a>; Trouillet,
<a href="#Page_298">page 298</a>.</p></div>

<p>Everything I have personally observed in freezing
windholes shows that in them also the cold of winter and
not evaporation is the cause of the ice. They answer to
the same tests as other glacières, of geographical distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">« 158 »</a></span>
and altitude, nearness of ice to the outside, thermometric
observations, and dampness of the air when
the ice melts. Equally with other glacières, the movements
of air in windholes do not depend on the presence
of ice, but the ice does depend on the movements
of air and a water supply at the proper time. A proof
that it is the cold of winter which makes the ice in
windholes, is that the ice is always found at the lower
extremity, for the reason that it is at that end that the
cold air enters and to that end that the water gravitates.
The reason that ice is more rarely found in windholes
than in apparently static caves, is due to the movements
of air. Unlike the caves where the heavy cold
air preserves the ice by remaining pent up, as soon as
the outside temperature rises the heavy cold air in windholes
tumbles out at the lower opening and is replaced
gradually by air at a higher temperature. This also
flows out and when it is above freezing point, it naturally
melts the ice and becomes humid: in fact, it vaporizes
the ice as it passes, and dissipates the moisture
into the outer air.</p>

<p>It is, however, certain, that in caves with a temperature
some degrees above freezing point, when there is
either running water or strong drips, evaporation may
be, and sometimes undoubtedly is, a factor in lowering
the temperature somewhat.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As in some windholes there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">« 159 »</a></span>
is occasionally moisture on the rock surfaces where the
air current passes, the evaporation from these surfaces
doubtless lowers the temperature of the draughts, and
it may be, also those of the rock surfaces, a little.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_64" id="Footnote_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> See Part IV.: De Saussure, <a href="#Page_274">page 274</a>. See also <i>Les Abimes</i>,
1894, page 564.</p></div>

<p>Further observations, however, will be necessary in
regard to evaporation underground, as the data are still
insufficient to make absolutely positive statements.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> I
fail to see any evidence to show that evaporation ever
lowers the temperature of draughts underground below
freezing point, only that it may help to lower them to
something less than they would otherwise be. Taking
all the facts which I have myself observed, and all I
have read of in the reports of others, my own conclusion
is that we have no proof that evaporation underground
is ever strong enough to produce ice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65" id="Footnote_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Several observers consider evaporation as more or less of a factor
in the production of cold underground. It is suggested also, that
in certain cases, at high altitudes, evaporation tends to prevent the
melting of the ice in windholes, but this is not proved, as yet. See
Part IV.: De Saussure, <a href="#Page_274">page 274</a>; Fugger, <a href="#Page_296">page 296</a>; Trouillet, <a href="#Page_298">page 298</a>;
Martel, <a href="#Page_300">page 300</a>; Lohmann, <a href="#Page_302">page 302</a>.</p></div>


<p class="pmt2"><i>Time of Formation of Ice.</i>&mdash;Everything I have seen
points to the fact that ice begins to form in a cave as
soon as the temperature of the cave has sunk below
freezing point, whenever, from any cause, water gets
into the cave. The cold may begin to penetrate caves
as soon as outside frosts have occurred, that is in the
fall months, about November; and as soon as the temperature
inside sinks below freezing point, ice will begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">« 160 »</a></span>
to form, provided also that water gets into the cave,
from rains or springs or any other source.</p>

<p>In the mid-winter months, although there is then
plenty of cold, the water supply is generally lacking, as
the outside moisture is mostly frozen up and the result
is that the winter months are not those when the ice is
mainly formed. Some is undoubtedly formed in certain
caves whenever during the course of the winter a surface
thaw outside furnishes water to the cave,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> but in other
cases this is not so and the ice does not appear before
the spring. In all cases it is in the spring, before the
cave has parted with its store of cold, and when both
the air and the rock walls are chilled below freezing
point<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that the ice forms fastest. Then plenty of water
is furnished by the melting of the snows and the unlocking
of the brooks, and also by early spring rains.
All this surface water runs through the fissures into the
still freezing cave and there becomes ice. Not only the
air, but also the rock walls are chilled below freezing
point, and as the rocks part slowly with the cold stored
in them, this cold helps to freeze the water pouring in.</p>

<p>The natural law in relation to time seems to be this:
Ice may be formed in caves as soon as the outside temperature
sinks below freezing point. In some caves it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">« 161 »</a></span>
forms intermittently all through the cold months because
there is a water supply. In other caves it only forms
in the spring, because there is no water supply in the
winter months. In all cases, however, the end of winter
is the time when most of the ice is formed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buried or Fossil Glaciers, North Greenland.</span>
(W. E. Meehan, <i>Philadelphia Ledger</i>, 1896.)&mdash;On Robertson&rsquo;s
Bay is the plateau of the Verhoef Glacier, which
is about 1500 meters long and 400 meters wide, and stands
back only a few meters from the edge of the sea. This
plateau, both top and sides, is a mass of flourishing vegetation,
chiefly grass, which reaches above a man&rsquo;s knee.
From among this verdure buttercups, poppies, cinquefoils
and dandelions thrust their golden heads in wild profusion.
Similar buried glaciers are found in many places along
the fiords of North Greenland.</p>

<p>Mr. Meehan gives a simple explanation in connection
with the Verhoef Glacier. He says that this glacier formerly
extended out into the sea, and that while it moved
forward, the clump moss, which struggles for existence
in Greenland gorges, could do little more than hold its
own. In course of time, from some unknown cause, the
glacier receded to the point where it now discharges, the
part in the water floating away in the shape of icebergs,
and the part on the shore remaining stationary. This was
the opportunity for the clump mosses. Caring nothing for
the cold they crept slowly over the quiet mass of ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">« 166 »</a></span>
and made their way first in thin net-like layers, later in
thick masses, till they reached the rocky shore. Year
after year the mosses grew, the young plants trampling
underfoot the older; until the latter, rotting, turned into
a rich mould. The seeds of grasses and flowers found
their way to this, blown by the wind or carried on the
feet of birds. The plateau now is a garden of green,
gold and white. How long this will last it is impossible
to say, as any time nature may unloose its hold, and
the frozen river once more pour down into the bay.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Subsoil Ice in Alaska.</span> (I. C. Russell, <i>A Journey
up the Yukon River</i>, page 149, and <i>Second Expedition
to Mount Saint Elias</i>, page 19.)&mdash;Professor Russell found
ice covered by rocks and vegetation in several places in
Alaska, especially along the southern edge of the Malaspina
Glacier and on the Yukon River. He gives the
following interesting account in 1890 of these ice sheets:
"Throughout the length of the Yukon, one is frequently
reminded of the high latitude drained by the great river,
by seeing strata of ice in the recently cut banks, beneath
the dense layer of moss and roots forming the surface on
which the forests grow. One may frequently find ice even
on a hot summer&rsquo;s day, by scraping away the moss at his
feet. In some instances the frozen layer has been penetrated
to the depth of twenty-five feet, but its full depth
has never been ascertained. In the banks of some of the
streams to the north of the lower Yukon, strata of ice over
a hundred feet thick have been observed, and the indications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">« 167 »</a></span>
are that its total depth is considerably greater than
the portion exposed. This subsoil ice is stagnant and
without the characteristics of glaciers."</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Subsoil Ice in the Klondike Region.</span> (<i>Philadelphia
Ledger</i>, December 30th, 1897.)&mdash;The Klondike mining
country is covered with snow most of the year. The
ground is frozen for ten or twelve meters in depth, down
to bed rock. In some places the ground, which is protected
by a thick moss, is not thawed out by the sun in
summer. The miner cuts off the moss with a shovel,
and then builds a fire, which thaws out the ground for
five or ten centimeters. He digs this out, rebuilds a
fire, and then continues this process.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Ice Cliffs on the Kowak River, Alaska.</span> (Lieutenant
J. C. Cantwell, <i>National Geographic Magazine</i>,
October, 1896.)&mdash;On the shores of the Kowak River are a
series of ice cliffs of from about 25 meters to 45 meters in
height. On top of these ice cliffs is a layer of black silt-like
soil some 2 meters in thickness, and from this springs
a luxuriant growth of mosses, grass and Arctic shrubbery.
The melted ice shows a residuum of fine dust, which while
fresh emits a pungent odor.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Subterranean Ice Sheet on Kotzebue Sound.</span> (Otto
von Kotzebue, <i>Entdeckungsreise in die Südsee</i>, etc. Weimar,
1821. Vol. IV., page 140.)&mdash;Dr. Eschholz discovered
near Kotzebue Sound, in 1816, a mass of ice more than 30
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">« 168 »</a></span>
meters thick, and entirely covered with a layer at least 15
centimeters thick of clay, sand, and earth, on which heavy,
long grass was growing. In the ice and in the soil overlaying
it, were many remains of extinct animals. On the
side towards the ocean the ice was entirely bare, exposed
to sun and air, and much of it was melting away in
streamlets.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Lava Caves, Washington.</span> (R. W. Raymond,
<i>Overland Monthly</i>, 3d November, 1869, page 421. Th.
Kirchhoff, <i>Reisebilder und Skizzen aus America</i>, 1876,
vol. II., page 211. <i>Philadelphia Ledger</i>, September 25th,
1899.)&mdash;These caves are distant about four hours from the
foot of Mount Adams, and about 56 kilometers from the
mouth of the White Salmon River, where it falls into the
Columbia River. The caves are in basalt, and they are
connected at both ends with the open air. Only a few of
them contain any ice, which in the largest cave is about
6 meters below the entrance, from which one descends
by a ladder. The cave opens on one side and is some
15 meters in depth, 6 meters or 8 meters in width and
3 meters or 4 meters in height. This part contains the
most ice. The other side gradually narrows from the entrance,
is longer, and reaches out through fallen rocks
and rubbish to daylight. In the lower portion, there are
a few ice stalactites and stalagmites: one a superb, transparent
hillock, which rises nearly to the roof, is called
the Iceberg. A strong draught flows into the cave in
summer through the open arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">« 169 »</a></span></p>

<p>The following paragraphs from the <i>Philadelphia Ledger</i>
probably refer to the same locality:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ice for the cutting, and that in August and early in
September, is a novelty not often found in regions as far
south as the Columbia River basin; but the novelty is
enjoyed every year by people who visit the ice caves under
the shadow of Mount Adams, about 100 miles northeast
of Portland. It is a very extensive region. Frank McFarland,
who has just returned from a six weeks&rsquo; vacation
camping trip there, gives an interesting account of its general
make up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the ice caves, which are six miles from Trout
Lake, the stalactites are more beautiful and wonderful this
year than ever before, and this was Mr. McFarland&rsquo;s fifteenth
trip there. He broke off and took to camp chunks
of ice weighing 100 pounds. Pleasure parties who come to
the lake use considerable of the ice for packing their trout
to take home. All you have to do is to take a torch of
pitch pine or a lantern, and go into the big caves and pack
off all the ice you want. It is a sure crop, and never fails.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Ice Spring in the Rocky Mountains, Oregon.</span> (G.
Gibbs, <i>American Journal of Science and Arts</i>, 1853, Second
Series, vol. XV., page 146.)&mdash;The Ice Spring is about 60
kilometers from the South Pass to the right of the Sweetwater
River. It is situated in a low marshy swale, where
the ground is filled with springs; and about 60 centimeters
below the turf is a sheet of horizontal ice, some 10 centimeters
to 30 centimeters thick, lasting throughout the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">« 170 »</a></span>
year. The ice is clear and is disposed in hexagonal
prisms; it has a slightly saline taste, the ground above it
being impregnated with salt and the water near by tasting
of sulphur.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Lava Caves in Modoc County, California.</span>
(<i>Dispatch</i>, Frankford, Pennsylvania, 22d January, 1897,
reprinted from another paper.)&mdash;The lava beds, where the
Modoc Indians made their last stand against the United
States troops, are described as an immense field of lava
covered with a beautiful forest of conifers. Numerous
caves of varying shapes and dimensions are scattered
throughout these lava beds. Some are mere covert ways,
with an arch of stone thrown over them; others are immense
chambers some meters from the surface; another
kind sinks deeply and may be in a series of chambers
united by a corridor that opens at the surface; while
another kind seems to go directly to the centre of the
earth without stopping. Some of these caves contain ice
and from them the Modocs drew their water supply while
besieged by the troops. Judging from what is reported
of the caves the quantity of ice in them must be large.
The thermometer in winter in the region is said to go
as low as -30&deg; C.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Lava Beds near Medicine Lake, Siskiyou
County, Northern California.</span> (M. S. Baker, <i>Sierra
Club Bulletin</i>, 1899. Vol. II., page 318.)&mdash;"One other feature
of the lava region must be mentioned&mdash;the ice caves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">« 171 »</a></span>
There are several of these known, and very likely many
more remain undiscovered. Those located along the edge
of the lava, near the cinder cone, I have known to contain
ice and water as late as August. The largest I have
seen is on the Mayfield Road, about twenty miles east of
Bartles. It is situated in the barren lava, and in one of
the warmest localities of the region,&mdash;and there are few
cool spots in the lava anywhere. One enters the cave by
crawling down a hole none too large. The instant the
interior is reached the temperature falls in a surprising
way. Not more than ten feet below the surface of the
hot rocks is a bed of ice, covered by a foot or so of ice
water. The body of ice was perhaps twelve or fifteen
feet long, by five feet across in the widest places. This
cave is formed by a fissure that extends a distance of
twenty miles from the ice cave to Pittville, and nearly
coincides with the 4000 foot level, as shown in the map.
Along the southeastern half of this earth fissure the southwest
wall has faulted, leaving a cliff, which, in places, must
be nearly 200 feet high."</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Shafts, Montana.</span>&mdash;Mr. Robert Butler, of
San José, Cal., has given me much information about glacières
in Montana. He visited one miners&rsquo; shaft which is
situated about 80 kilometers up the Rosebud River from
Rosebud Station on the Northern Pacific R. R., and about
10 kilometers northeast of the Cheyenne Indian Agency.
It is on the north slope of the Little Wolf Mountains, near
the summit, at the head of Greenleaf Creek. The canyon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span>
and surrounding slopes are covered with a dense growth
of pine. The rock has the appearance of scoriæ caused
by the burning of immense beds of coal in recent geological
times. The rock is broken into comparatively
small pieces. The altitude is some 1200 meters. The
forest, the volcanic ash and the altitude, besides the loose
rock formation, makes this place a natural ice house.
Ten or twelve years ago three prospectors, looking for
silver, sunk a shaft here. At a depth of about 4 meters
it began to grow cold, and at 6 meters they found ice
and imagined they could feel an upward draught. Being
ignorant and superstitious, they became frightened and
abandoned the shaft. During the winter, the snow fills
the shaft half full of ice, which then remains over through
the summer. There is a general report and belief among
those who have visited the well, that it freezes in summer
and thaws in winter. There are thousands of mining
shafts in Montana, and if they are on the north slope
of a mountain of considerable altitude and under a
dense forest and not too deep, they generally have ice at
the bottom during the summer. It is also said to be nothing
new for a miner in following crevices to find them
filled with ice, especially if near the surface on the north
slope of a mountain.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Cave, Fergus County, Montana.</span>&mdash;Mr.
Robert Butler, of San José, Cal., visited this place, which
is about 35 kilometers southeast of Lewistown. It is on
the north side of a butte. Masses of ice and great icicles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">« 173 »</a></span>
form in some parts of the cave in such quantities during
the latter part of winter that the cave furnishes ice for
cooling the drinking water for several dozen families.
During July and August the people come from some
distance around to get the ice. The people in the neighborhood
believe that the ice forms in summer and thaws
away in winter. They also speak of the ever upward
draught of cold air coming possibly from some great
hidden cavern in the lower recesses of the mountain.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Well at Horse Plains, Montana.</span> (Levi
Allen, <i>Scientific American</i>. New Series, 27th October,
1883.)&mdash;The well is described as 13.60 meters deep. It is
dug through solid gravel, and in sinking it there was
encountered, at a depth of 10.60 meters, a current of
air strong enough to blow out a candle. It began to
freeze in September, 1882, and in November it was
frozen solid.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Silver Mine, Bighorn County, Wyoming.</span>&mdash;This
place is in the Sunlight Basin of the Shoshone
Mountains. Mr. William Worrell Wagner, of Philadelphia,
informs me that he visited it in August, 1897. It is a
silver mine or tunnel, running straight into the mountain
for about 60 meters, at an altitude of about 3300 meters.
The peaks of the Teton range were in sight from the
mouth of the tunnel. For the first half of the way in, a
good many icicles were hanging from the rocks. The last
half of the tunnel was thickly coated with ice and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">« 174 »</a></span>
like a cold storage plant. Snow disappears on the rocks
outside about June, and begins to fall again in September,
so that Mr. Wagner&rsquo;s visit was at about the hottest time
of the year. Mr. Wagner presented the meat of a bull
wapiti he had shot to the miners, and they stored it in
the mine as if it had been an artificial refrigerator.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Rifts of Ice, Mount McClellan, Colorado.</span> (Edward
L. Berthoud, <i>American Journal of Science and Arts</i>. Third
Series, 1876, vol. XI., page 108.)&mdash;Near the summit of
Mount McClellan, is the Centennial Lode, which runs into
the mountain, at an altitude of about 3900 meters. Intercalated
in the mineral vein are three or four well defined
veins of solid ice parallel with the bedding of the rock
and filling all its inner side-cracks and fissures. The
same frozen substratum is found in two other lodes near
by on the same mountain. Nothing of the kind is known
on other Colorado mountains. The soil is loose and
largely made up of rocky débris, which shows that the
ice is probably due to local causes.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Tunnel on the Hagerman Pass, Colorado.</span>
(<i>Philadelphia Press</i>, October 16th, 1897.)&mdash;The Hagerman
Pass Railroad line is said to have been abandoned
after the completion of the Busk-Ivanhoe tunnel, but to
have been rebuilt. The Hagerman tunnel for a distance
of over 700 meters was filled with solid ice, and it required
blasting with dynamite, and a month&rsquo;s continuous labor,
day and night, to dig the ice out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">« 175 »</a></span></p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Cavern in Cow Mountain, Colorado.</span>
(<i>Post Dispatch</i>, St. Louis, Mo., July 13th, 1897, and September
5th, 1897. <i>Mail Order Monthly</i>, St. Paul, Minn.,
October, 1899.)&mdash;The cave was discovered by parties doing
assessment work on a group of claims. A man was
picking in a three meter hole when he struck his pick
into an opening, which was gradually enlarged and
showed a deep pit underneath. The men got a rope
and descended into an immense cavern full of ice.
Later exploration led to a small hall, some 5 meters in
diameter, full of icicles. From here a fissure led into a
second rock chamber larger than the first. A small hole
in the floor at an angle of some 45&deg; gave access to a
third and larger hall, about 25 meters by 40 meters. Great
masses of ice were found in this, also a small lake, about
12 meters by 20 meters. &ldquo;Some who have visited the
wonderful discovery are of the opinion that it is a great
cave or fissure in a glacier which for centuries has been
slowly making its way down from Pike&rsquo;s Peak and whose
waters are now feeding the Arkansas River.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Windhole, Arizona.</span> (<i>Christian Herald</i>, March 24th,
1897.)&mdash;Mr. Cofman, while drilling a well on his place, is
said to have opened a windhole from which the escaping
air current was strong enough to blow off the hats of the
men who were recovering the lost drill. Some days the
air escapes with such force that pebbles the size of peas
are thrown up, accompanied by a sound much like the
distant bellowing of a fog horn. Again for days there will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span>
be a suction current, unaccompanied by sound, in which the
current of air passes into the earth with somewhat less
force than when escaping, and any light object, as a feather
or a piece of paper, will be immediately sucked in. The
account is probably exaggerated.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Lava Cave near Flagstaff, Arizona.</span>&mdash;Professor
W. B. Scott of Princeton University told me of
this cave, which he had not visited himself. It lies 14.5
kilometers south of Flagstaff, on the Mesa table land, at
an altitude of about 2000 meters. It was described to
Professor Scott as a double cave, with two floors, one over
the other, the lower containing the most ice. It is in lava,
and can only be entered by crawling in on hands and
knees.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Cave or Gorge, White Mountains, Arizona.</span>&mdash;Mr.
Frank Hamilton Cushing has told me of this
place. It is a cleft among lava rock, which being roofed at
the further end, might be described as a cave. In this the
ice remains until June or July, much later than anywhere
else in the neighborhood. The Zuni Indians worship before
this, calling the ice the breath of the Gods, the snow
they consider as a sort of down. The region is arid,
which makes any water precious, and this fact has developed
the element of mysticism about snow and ice
among the Indians.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Cave near Galena, Black Hills, South
Dakota.</span> (Miss L. A. Owen, <i>Cave Regions of the Ozarks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">« 177 »</a></span>
and Black Hills</i>. Cincinnati, 1898, page 209): &ldquo;At Galena,
a new mining town of golden promise, there is reported to
be an Ice Cave, where ice forms at all seasons, and during
the warm weather is a source of comfort and pleasure to
the miners.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Windholes in the Ozark Mountains, Missouri.</span>&mdash;Mr.
H. F. Brinckerhoff, of Aurora, Mo., informs me that there
are a number of cold air current caves in the Ozark Mountain
region. One of them is some 19 kilometers south of
Aurora, Lawrence County, and is used for cold storage in
summer. There is a cave in a limestone bluff about 15
meters above a river, and in the rear is this windhole,
which is an opening about 30 centimeters high and 3
meters wide. A strong current of air comes out from it in
summer, and the hotter the air outside, the stronger is the
outward coming current. In winter the current is reversed.
The outward current is so strong in very hot
weather that a handkerchief held in it is straightened out
to an angle of about 45&deg;.</p>

Kovarik, <i>Scientific American Supplement</i>, No. 1195, November

<p>On June 1st, 1869, Dr. White found the ice dry and
well frozen, and he thought it was then accumulating. The
cave was cool and apparently dry, and no strong air current
was passing through.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1897, a cold breeze was noticed
coming from the cave to a distance of at least 30 meters.
At the entrance the breeze was strong enough to blow
out a candle. This breeze was not noticed at other
times. From December to February inclusive, on the
contrary, the breeze was reversed. From July to October,
1897, the walls of the cave were moist. From October
to February they were dry. In February frost began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">« 179 »</a></span>
appear on the walls. On March 12th, 1898, the walls
were covered with frost. The ice appeared at a spot
nearly at the end of the cave on the 26th of March, 1898.
At a place about 6.50 meters nearer the entrance, however,
is where most ice forms. This place Mr. Kovarik
calls <i>Locus Glacialis</i>. The ice appeared here about the
29th of May, 1898. It increased rapidly up to June 12th,
when it was at its maximum, and was about two meters
in width. It generally covers the north wall from top
to base. The greatest thickness in 1898 was 29 centimeters.</p>

<p>The temperature which Mr. Kovarik recorded on the
16th of April at <i>Locus Glacialis</i> of +1.1 seems an anomalous
one. On writing to him he sent me the following
explanation: "April 16th, after I left the thermometer at
<i>Locus Glacialis</i> the usual time, I noticed that it registered
+1.1&deg; C. It seemed singular, for at both the Division
and the End, the thermometer registered considerably
lower. I left the thermometer at its place for about an
hour longer, and noticed then that it did not register
differently. I would suggest this explanation: This is
true about water that upon freezing it gives off its latent
heat. Now on April 16th some water dripped into the
cave on the wall near where the thermometer was, about
1.50 meters from the floor. The amount of water was very
small, but as it came in contact with the cold wall it began
to give out its latent heat which affected the close by
thermometer. The temperature of the rock was without
doubt between -1.&deg; and -3&deg;."</p>

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Cavern at Brainard, Iowa.</span> (Alois F. Kovarik,

little cave is situated on the north side of a hill
about 1.5 kilometers northwest of Brainard. It is about
4.50 meters deep. On June 10th, 1899, Mr. Kovarik
found the floor and walls covered with ice. The temperature
was 0&deg; C. The owner claims to have taken
enough ice out of it on July 4th, 1897, to freeze cream.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Freezing Cave near Elkinsville, Brown County,
Indiana.</span> (Clipping from a western newspaper, 1896.)&mdash;The
entrance is said to be overlapped by trees and to
resemble a mine shaft. The winding way leads to a
hollow some 15 meters below the surface, resembling a
broad vaulted corridor, which is known to the natives as
the devil&rsquo;s chamber and where the temperature is low.
From this point several galleries lead further in, and from
one of them comes a blast of icy cold air. This passage
is similar to the one at the entrance to the cave, but after
a few meters frost is visible, and further on it is thick on
all sides, like the crust that is formed on the pipes of an
ice plant. The narrow way leads to a big chamber, known
as the ice vault. In this dome, which is fully 30 meters in
width, the ice forms a large stalagmite and is of unknown
depth.</p>

is regularly used in summer by the people near by.
Constant and strong air currents issue from the crevices

cave. The walls were covered with ice and icicles and
a few small ice cones rose on the ice floor.</p>

<p>The earliest notice of a glacière which I have been
able to find is in the shape of a letter giving an account
of a visit to the Glacière de Chaux-les-Passavant
in 1584, by Benigne Poissenot, a French lawyer. The
account, which I have translated as literally as possible,
is in a special chapter, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;Since our separation, I have had this pleasure
(<i>heut</i>) to hear news of you only once, having found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">« 194 »</a></span>
your brother in Paris; who, having assured me of your
good health (<i>disposition</i>), informed me of how since we
had seen each other you had travelled to Italy, even
as far as Greece, of which you had seen a large portion:
and that sound and safe, after so long a journey, you
had reappeared and landed at Havre de Grace where
you wished to go, that is to say at home. All the
pleasure which a friend can receive, knowing the affairs
of another self, joined to such a happy result, seized my
heart, at the recital of such agreeable news: and I did
not fail shortly after, to write you amply all which had
happened to me since I left you until my return to
France: congratulating you at having escaped from marine
abysses and perilous passages on land, on which
travellers are often constrained to risk their life. From
this time, I have always stayed in Paris or in the neighborhood,
according to the good pleasure of dame fortune,
who ruled me in her wise and fed me with her
dishes the most common and ordinary until the first day
of January of the year 1584, when I received my first
gift in the shape of a strong and violent disease, which
tormented me more than a month: from which, having
become cured with the help of God, and having with
time recovered my health and my strength at the arrival
of spring, I was seized with the desire to smell the
air of the country. And in fact having thrown away
my pen and travelled about (<i>battu l&rsquo;estrade</i>) through
high and low Burgundy, I stopped at Bezenson, Imperial
City, to spend the summer. This city is still to day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">« 195 »</a></span>
just the same as Julius Cæsar describes it, in the notable
mention he makes of it, in the first book of his commentaries
of the war in Gaul, there remaining there all
the vestiges of the most remarkable things, which he
tells of in his description. There are also very fine
fountains, from all of which water streams from the representation
of some god of antiquity, as a Neptune, a Bacchus,
a Pan, a Nereide or others: except before the state
house, where the statue of Charles the Fifth, representing
him in a most natural manner, is placed on an eagle,
which from its beak, pours out such a great quantity of
water that this is the most beautiful, among all the other
fountains. And as I do not doubt that while traversing
Italy, you both saw and examined with curiosity the most
handsome singularities, which presented themselves to
your eyes and that on your return, passing through
Avignon and Dauphiné, as your brother informed me,
you had the advantage over me of seeing the wonders of
the country, of which you had heard me speak sometimes,
regretting that the war, during the time I was in that
quarter, had prevented my going to the spot, to see the
burning fountain as in Dodone, and the fountain called
Jupiter, which torches of fire light up and which grows
less till midday and then grows till midnight, and then diminishes
and fails at midday: and another in Epirus which
we call to day Albania, the tower without venom and the
inaccessible mountain: then as I said, since you have
contemplated these things and several others not less
admirable, I wish to entertain you about a marvel which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">« 196 »</a></span>
I saw, during my sojourn in Bezenson, to know from you,
whether in all your journey, you saw a similar thing.
Know then that the day of the festival of St. John Baptist,
a young man, provided with an honest knowledge,
with whom I had made some little acquaintance, presented
me with an icicle, to cool my wine at dinner, and
which I admired greatly, on account of the time of the
year in which we then were, begging him who gave it
to me to tell me where he had discovered this rare present
for that time. He answered me that every year, the
day of the solemnity of the festival of St. John Baptist,
the inhabitants of a village, which he named, were bound
to come to offer the great church of St. John of Bezenson,
a goodly quantity of ice, which they got in a wood,
and brought to town at night on horses, for fear that by
day it should melt, and that one of his cronies had given
to him what he had given to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly there flamed up in me a desire to see this
place, where in the height of the summer, ice was to be
found. When he who had presented me with the icicle
saw this, he promised to accompany me, not having as yet,
any more than myself, seen this marvel. I did not hatch
very long this decision, all the more as all those, to whom
I mentioned it, encouraged me to carry it out as soon as I
could, assuring me that I should see a strange thing, and
that even the Duke of Alva on his return from Flanders,
passing through Franche Comté, had wished to see this
novelty. Therefore calling on the promise of the one
who was the cause of undertaking this journey, we went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">« 197 »</a></span>
together to Versey, a fine town, distant five leagues from
Bezenson, turning a little off our direct route, to go to
see a literary man, at this said Versey, who having called
on me at Bezenson, had extracted from me the promise of
going to see him. There happened to me in this spot,
what the poet du Bellay says happened to him, on his
return from Italy, passing through the Grisons, to go into
France: who, after having chanted the troubles there are
in the passage, says that the Swiss made him drink so
much, that he does not remember anything he saw in that
country. Likewise, I can assure you that my host, following
the custom of those of the country (who do not think
they are treating a man properly if they do not make him
drink a lot, taking that from the Germans, their neighbors)
made us carouse so well, that when we went to bed, we
were very gay boys. For although we had both made an
agreement on the road, yet our host knew so well how to
win us over, saying that those who would not drink, gave
reason to think badly of them, and that they had committed,
or wished to commit some great crime, which they
feared to give away in drinking, that in the end we let
ourselves go, passing the time in Pantagruelic fashion.
The next morning having taken some &ldquo;hair from the
beast&rdquo; and a guide which our host gave to us to conduct
us to the <i>Froidiere</i>&mdash;we continued our wanderings, and
arrived at a little village called Chaud, joining a large
wood, where our guide told us, that although he had been
more than six times to the <i>Froidiere</i>, yet the road was so
tortuous and so cut up by small paths, that if we did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">« 198 »</a></span>
take a man from this village, to be more sure, we might
spend more than half a day in the wood, before finding
what we were seeking. Getting off our horses now, we
added to our company a native of the place, who having
led us by crooked roads, about a quarter of a league,
through the forest, made us enter into a close thicket and
by a little path led us to a pleasant meadow; where,
looking down, we saw a hole, of difficult descent, at the
bottom of which was the opening of a grotto, pretty big,
and so awful and terrifying to see, that one would have
said, it was the mouth of Hell. And in truth, I remembered
then, the hole of St. Patrick, which is said to be in
Hibernia. We were not brave enough knights, to try the
adventure, my companion and I, if our guides had not
taken the lead. After whom we descended as magnanimously
as the Trojan Duke followed the Sybil to the
Plutonic realms, the sword half drawn from the scabbard,
and well determined to make test of the Platonic doctrine,
which teaches that demons can be dissected, in case any
shade or spook should have come to meet us. About the
middle of the way, we began to feel in descending a very
agreeable freshness; for it was the second day of July and
the sun shone very warmly, which made us sweat drop by
drop. But we had good opportunity to refresh ourselves
and put ourselves to cool, having reached the grotto which
we found of the length and breadth of a large hall, all
paved with ice in the bottom, and where a crystalline water,
colder than that of the mountains of Arcadia Nonacris,
streamed from many small brooklets, which formed very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">« 199 »</a></span>
clear fountains, with the water of which I washed myself
and drank so eagerly, that I had wished the thirst of Tantalus,
or else that I had been bitten by a Dipsas, in order
to be always thirsty, amid such a pleasant beverage. A
great lord, who in some pleasure resort, should have such
a refrigerator in summer, could boast according to my
judgment, to be better provided with drink, than the kings
of Persia were with their river Coaspis, which engulphs
itself into the Tigris, the water whereof was so sweet, that
the use of it was allowed only to the great King, for the
retinue and cronies of his household. Do not think, that
among these delights, I was at all free from fear, for never
did I raise my eyes above that from terror my whole body
shivered and the hair stood up on my head, seeing the
whole roof of the grotto, covered with big massive icicles,
the least of which, falling on me, had been sufficient to
scramble up my brains and knock me to pieces; so much
so that I was like to that criminal, whom they say is
punished in Hell, by the continual fear of a big stone,
which seems as though it must suddenly fall on his ears.
There are besides the large hall of the grotto, some rather
roomy corners, where the gentlemen of the neighborhood,
put their venison to cool in summer, and we saw the
hooks, where they hang the wild fowl. It is true, that
when we were there, we saw neither game nor wild fowl,
and I think, that if we had found any of it, we were men
to carry off some of it. We walked around for about a
quarter of an hour, in this <i>Froidiere</i> and we should have
staid there longer if the cold had not driven us out; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">« 200 »</a></span>
struck in to our backs, even to make our teeth crack; we
reascended the slope, not forgetting, all of us as many as
we were, to provide and load ourselves with ice, which
served us at lunch in the little village mentioned above to
drink most delightfully, assuring you that it is impossible
to drink more freshly than we drank then. I thought of
those old voluptuaries, who cooled their wine with snow,
and it seemed to me, as though they might have had it
much cheaper if in their time there had been many such
<i>Froidieres</i>, to refresh it with ice, instead of with snow,
as some of the gentlemen of the neighborhood of the
<i>Froidiere</i> and some of the most notable persons of the
neighborhood of Bezenson do; who by night, have a
good supply brought on horses, which they keep in their
caves, and use at their meals and banquets. Turning
back towards the Imperial city of Bezenson, I carried for
about two great leagues, a rather large icicle in my hands,
which little by little melted and was a pleasant and agreeable
cooler, on account of the great heat of the weather.
After having thought over in my mind, the cause of this
<i>antiperistase</i>, I could find none other but this: to wit, that
as heat domineers in summer, the cold retires to places
low and subterranean, such as is this one, to which the rays
of the sun cannot approach, and that in such an aquatic
and humid place, it operates the results, which we have
shown above. Which seemed to me so much more likely,
that on asking the peasants of the neighboring village, if
in winter there was ice in this <i>Froidiere</i>, they answered me
that there was none, and that on the contrary, it was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">« 201 »</a></span>
warm there. Whatever may be the cause, whether this or
another, I can assure you, that I admired this singularity
as much as any I have seen, since a large church, cut into
a rock which I had seen a few years previously, in a little
town of Gascony called St. Milion, distant seven leagues
from Bordeaux; on the steeple of which is the cemetery,
where they bury the dead; a thing to be marvelled at by
him who has not seen it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have made trial, to enrich this missive, with all
the artifice which has come into my head, using the leisure,
which the present time brings me: as the temple of
Janus is open, the air beyond breathing nothing but war:
which forces me, against my wish, to sojourn in this place
longer than I had intended. If these troubles settle
down, and if after the rain, God sends us fine weather as
requires the calamitous state in which is now the flat
country, I shall return to my Parnassus; from which if
I go out hereafter, believe that it will be very much in
spite of myself, or that my will will have very much
changed. You will be able to let me hear from you there,
and take your revenge for the prolixity of this letter, by
sending me one still longer, which you will write to me
with more pleasure, as I shall take much in reading it.
However as it is becoming time to sound taps, I will pray
the sovereign creator for my affectionate recommendations
to your graces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, and best friend, may you keep in health and have
a long and happy life. From Sens this 20th of June 1585.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your obedient friend, BENIGNE POISSENOT.</p>

<p>&ldquo;End of the description of the marvel, called the
<i>Froidiere</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pmt2">The next notice about the Glacière de Chaux-les-Passavant
is by Gollut in 1592, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">&ldquo;Ices in<br />
summer.&rdquo;</div>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wish however to omit (since I am
in these waters) to bring to mind the commodity,
which nature has given to some dainty men, since
at the bottom of a mountain of Leugné ice is found in
summer, for the pleasure of those who wish to drink
cool. Nevertheless at this time, this is disappearing, for
no other reason (as I think) except, that they have despoiled
the top of the mountain, of a thick and high mass
of woods, which did not permit that the rays of the sun
came to warm the earth, and dry up the distillations,
which slipped down to the lowest and coldest part of the
mountain where (<i>by antiperistase</i>) the cold got thicker,
and contracted itself against the heats surrounding and
in the neighborhood during the whole summer, all the
external circumference of the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ice at Chaux-les-Passavant is said to have been
entirely cleared out, by the Duc de Lévi, in 1727, for the
use of the Army of the Saone. In 1743, when de Cossigny
visited the cave, the ice was formed again. There
are no reports about the intervening time between 1727
and 1743. The ice probably all re-formed the winter after
it was taken away.</p>

<p>Captain Trouillet in 1885 writes of Chaux-les-Passavant:
"The following winter had shown itself unfavorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">« 203 »</a></span>
to the production of ice, the periods of humidity
preceding too long ahead the periods of frost. Finally
last summer, coming after a wet spring, was exceptionally
warm. Such were the circumstances which brought about
in the glacière the ruin which could be seen at the end of
last October. *  *  * On the 11th of November, the first
effects of frost are felt and the temperature falls in the
glacière to -2&deg;: outside the thermometer drops to -3&deg;.
On the morning of the 12th, same result, and ice makes
its appearance in the grotto, as the report of the observer
shows: but the quantity produced is so small that
the internal thermometer soon goes above 0&deg;. It is only
on the 9th of December that the frost wins definitely; on
the 11th, 12th and 13th the chill is intense and reaches
-19&deg; outside, stopping at -15&deg; in the glacière. The water
coming from the rains between the 5th and the 9th drip
at this time through the roof and the big side crevasse:
circumstances grow favorable and the ice accumulates.
From the 17th, the entrance slope becomes almost impracticable;
the icicles grow on the roof, as big as the
body of a man. *  *  * From this time to the end of
December, the ice sheet does not increase, for water only
arrives by the rare drip of the roof, and only the stalactites
increase slowly. Outside, however, the cold continues
vigorously, the thermometer on the 31st of December
dropping to -15&deg; and to -13&deg; in the glacière. If the
production of the ice stops, it is not the cold which is
wanting, but the other element, the one which as our
former study showed, is the most rarely exact at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">« 204 »</a></span>
meeting. The winter is only favorable on condition that
it offers alternating periods of freezing and thawing; so
the observer writes in his report: 'it is the water which
is wanting, otherwise the glacière would be magnificent.'"</p>

<p>Trouillet speaks of the difficulty of winter observations
in the following words: &ldquo;Mons. Briot, the present lessor of
the glacière, has the unpaid mission of going every week
to the bottom of the grotto to get and put in place the
interior thermometer. It is a really hard piece of work
at this time of the year: each journey takes about one
hour. Besides the chance that a visitor has of receiving
on his head one of those magnificent stalactites 1 meter or
2 meters long which fall continually from the roof, it is
perfectly disagreeable to him to arrive at the base of the
slope otherwise than on the sole of his boots, and to face
thus the frequent and painful meeting with rocks whose
angular edges dot the surface of the descent, smooth as
a mirror set at an angle of 30&deg;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trouillet and Girardot obtained a series of observations
with maxima and minima thermometers at Chaux-les-Passavant
during the winter of 1885-1886. At the
end of November the temperature inside was +2&deg;. On
the 2d of December it rose to +2.5&deg;. On the 10th of
December, it sank to -1&deg;, and after this date, it remained
below freezing point all winter. The observations
were not continuous, but they showed that every
time the temperature outside dropped considerably, the
temperature inside immediately did likewise. For instance,
on the 12th of January, the outside air dropped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">« 205 »</a></span>
to -18&deg;, and the inside air responded by falling to
-15&deg;. On the other hand, when the temperature outside
rose above freezing point, the temperature inside
remained stationary or fluctuated only gently. For instance,
from the 24th of March to the 8th of April, the
outside air went up and down perpetually, the extremes
being -2&deg; and +16&deg;; while in the same time the inside
air rose continuously from -2&deg; to -0.5&deg;.</p>

During the winter of 1892-93 the water in it froze for a
thickness of 15 centimeters. The minimum outside temperature
that year was -17&deg;.</p>

France</i>, 1858, page 60.)&mdash;These windholes are in basalt.
There are many cracks, whence cold air currents issue,
and where ice has been found, sometimes in summer.
There are cold storage huts over some of the cracks.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Le Creux-de-Souci, Puy de Dome.</span> (Martel, <i>Les
Abimes</i>, 1894, Page 387.)&mdash;This is situated 5 kilometers
southeast of Besse-en-Chandesse. It is a large lava cavern
with the entrance directly in the middle of the roof.
The bottom is partly filled by a lake. The depth from the
surface of the ground to the lake is 33 meters; from the
smallest part of the opening to the lake the depth is
21.50 meters. Down this last portion one can descend
only by means of a rope ladder. The temperature is
extremely low; in general near freezing point. In June,
July, August and November 1892, Monsieur Berthoule,
<i>maire</i> of Besse, did not find any snow. On the 10th of
August, 1893, on the contrary, he found at the bottom a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">« 207 »</a></span>
heap of snow, which he thinks was formed in the cave
itself, by the freezing during their descent of the drops
of water which are constantly dripping from the roof.
He reports landing on <i>une montagne de neige, de neige
blanche</i>. On several visits, Mons. Berthoule noticed carbonic
acid gas in dangerous quantities. There was none
at the time he observed the snow heap, but ten days later
he found it impossible to descend into the cave as the
carbonic acid gas came up in puffs to the entrance. In
the lake, Mons. Berthoule discovered a variety of Rotifer,
<i>Notholca longispina</i>, and also several algæ and diatoms.
The <i>Asterionella formosa</i> is the most remarkable from its
abundance: it exists in some of the lakes of the Alps,
but not in those of the Pyrenees.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Aven de Lou Cervi, Vaucluse.</span> (Martel, <i>Les Abimes</i>,

which Mons. Martel calls <i>avens à rétrécissement</i>, or <i>abimes à
double orifice</i>. In September, 1892, Mons. Martel noted a
temperature of 6.5&deg; at 53 meters; of 6.8&deg; at 64 meters.

the bottom of the first gallery, on the 18th of September,
1892, the temperature of the air was 12.3&deg;, and that of
a pool of water supplied by drip 11.5&deg;. Mons. Martel
thought that the drip brought to the pool the mean annual
temperature of the ground through which it had come.
A little further within and 5 meters lower, the temperature
of the air was 7.3&deg; and that of another pool of water 6.8&deg;.
This pool was not supplied by drip and must have been
left over by the last flow of the spring. Mons. Martel
thought that the lower temperatures at this spot were
due to the cold air of winter dropping to the bottom of
the cave and on account of its density not being able
to get out.</p>

(<i>The Penny Magazine</i>, London, August, 1834, page
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">« 209 »</a></span>
335.)&mdash;Mr. Bunford Samuel called my attention to an article
in which the Southern Italians are said to dig wells or
cellars on the mountain sides, and to throw snow into them
in winter. The snow is well pressed together and straw,
dried leaves, etc., is thrown on top. By having a northern
exposure for these pits, and seeing that they are in thick
forest, or in rifts where the sun does not penetrate, these
depots may be safely placed as low down the mountain as
the snow falls and lies. Naples is largely supplied [1834]
with snow in summer from such snow wells situated on
Monte Angelo, the loftiest point of the promontory separating
the Bay of Naples from the Bay of Salerno.</p>

Cesi, in the town of Cesi. The cellar acted as a natural
refrigerator. The air stream was so strong, that it nearly
blew out the torches. In winter the wind rushed into the

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Krypta Sorana.</span> (Kircher, <i>Mundus Subterraneus</i>, 1664,

glacière cave, but as there is much doubt in the matter,
I quote the passages, on which the reports are based, in
the original Latin: &ldquo;Cryptae sunt naturales, quarum innumerae
sunt species, juxta vires naturales iis inditas.
Sunt nonnullae medicinali virtute praeditae, quaedam
metallicis vaporibus, exhalationibus, aquis scatent, sunt

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Subterranean Ice Sheet, Mount Etna, Sicily.</span>
(Lyell, <i>Principles of Geology, 11th Edition</i>, chapter
XXVI.)&mdash;This ice sheet is near the Casa Inglese. Sir
Charles Lyell ascertained the fact of its existence in 1828,
and in 1858 he found the same mass of ice, of unknown
extent and thickness, still unmelted. In the beginning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">« 211 »</a></span>
the winter of 1828, Lyell found the crevices in the interior
of the summit of the highest cone of Etna encrusted with
thick ice, and in some cases hot vapors actually streaming
out between masses of ice and the rugged and steep
walls of the crater. Lyell accounts for this ice sheet by
the explanation that there must have been a great snow
bank in existence at the time of an eruption of the volcano.
This deep mass of snow must have been covered
at the beginning of the eruption by volcanic sand showered
on it, followed by a stream of lava. The sand is a
bad conductor of heat and together with the solidified
lava, preserved the snow from liquefaction.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Glacière on the Moncodine.</span> (Fugger, <i>Eishöhlen</i>,
page 13.)&mdash;The Moncodine is described as a Dolomite
near the Lago di Como. The cave lies up the Val Sasina,
two hours from Cortenuova, at an altitude of 1675 meters.
The entrance faces north, and is 2.5 meters high and 1.5
meters wide. The average diameter of the cave is 16
meters. The floor is solid ice, which has been sometimes
cut for use in the hotels on the Lago di Como and even
been sent to Milan.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">La Ghiacciaia del Mondole.</span> (Fugger, <i>Eishöhlen</i>,

near Mondovi, south of Turin. The cave lies on the
eastern slope, at an altitude of about 2000 meters. It is
hard to get at. The entrance is to the east, and is 2
meters wide and 1.5 meters high. A passageway some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">« 212 »</a></span>
25 meters long leads to a large chamber where there is
plenty of ice. In hot summers ice is brought from the
cave to Mondovi. <i>Ghiacciaia</i> means freezing cavern in
Italian.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">La Ghiacciaia del Val Séguret.</span> (Fugger, <i>Eishöhlen</i>,

cliffs, at an altitude of about 1500 meters. The cave is
said to be about 40 meters deep, 50 meters wide and 50
meters high. Bonetti in May, 1874, found many icicles
and ice cones.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">La Borna de la Glace.</span> (Chanoine Carrel, <i>Bibliothèque

in a spot called Plan Agex. The altitude is 1602 meters.
The entrance opens to the east and is 60 centimeters wide
and 80 centimeters high. One can descend for 4 meters.
There are two branches in the rear of the entrance.
Chanoine Carrel found an ice pillar 1 meter high in the
western branch. He recorded these temperatures on the
15th of July, 1841: Outside +15&deg;. Entrance +2.9&deg;. East

39.)&mdash;It lies on the Foire de Font d&rsquo;Urle, 16 kilometers
north of Dié, 48 kilometers east of Valence, and 80 kilometers
south of Grenoble. The glacière consists of two
large pits, lying east and west, and with underground
communication. From this tunnel a long low archway
leads to a broad slope of chaotic blocks of stone, which
is 60 meters long and 42 meters in greatest width. The
ice begins half way down this slope, fitfully at first and
afterwards in a tolerably continuous sheet. Thury found
many icicles hanging from the roof. Browne found four
columns of ice, of which the largest was 5.80 meters across
the base. On his visit, in the middle of August, the ice
was strongly thawing. Both explorers noted the extremely
prismatic character of the ice. Browne found a
temperature of +0.5&deg;. Martel gives a section and plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">« 214 »</a></span>
of Font d&rsquo;Urle. Mons. Villard says about this cavern:
&ldquo;A curious thing: I found in this cave, motionless on
a piece of rock, entirely surrounded by ice for a distance
of several meters, a blind specimen of a coleoptera,
<i>Cytodromus dapsoïdes</i>.&rdquo;</p>

and the Pic Costebelle, at an altitude of 1,740 meters.
There is first a pit 18 meters long, 4.50 meters wide and
25 meters deep. In the bottom of this is a vertical hole
15 meters deep and from 1 meter to 2 meters in diameter,
in which there was much ice on the 31st of July, 1896.
Then the pit changes to a sloping gallery which terminates
in a little hall, full of ice, at a depth of 70 meters. Martel
gives a cut and section of this glacière.</p>

this glacière l&rsquo;Haut d&rsquo;Aviernoz; Mr. Browne calls it the
Glacière du Grand Anu. By a plumb line held from the
edge of the larger pit, Browne found that the ice floor was
about 35 meters from the surface, which would give a level
for the ice floor closely identical to the one I found. In
July, 1864, he recorded a temperature of +1.1&deg;.</p>

with a steep slope of broken rock leading to a rock portal
in the face of a low cliff. This opens into a roughly
circular hall about 22 meters in diameter and 3 meters to
4 meters in height. A chink between the rock and the
ice permitted Mr. Browne to scramble down three or four
meters to where a tunnel entered the ice mass. Throwing
a log of wood down this tunnel, a crash was heard
and then a splash of water, and then a strange gulping
sound. "The tunnel obviously led to a subglacial reservoir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">« 216 »</a></span>
and this was probably covered by a thin crust of ice;
the log in falling had broken this and then disturbed the
water below, which then commenced bubbling up and
down through the hole, and making a gulping noise, just
as it does sometimes when oscillating up and down in a
pipe."</p>

<p>Mons. C. Dunant of the <i>Club Alpin Français</i> describes
a visit to the Glacière de l&rsquo;Enfer. He mentions also a
legend of a witch from a neighboring village who would
get the ice from these caves and bring it down in the
shape of hail on the crops of the peasants who were inhospitable
to her.</p>

(Browne, <i>Ice Caves</i>, etc., page 182, and <i>Good Words</i>,
November, 1866.)&mdash;Mr. Browne calls it the Glacière de
Chappet-Sur-Villaz. Mr. Browne and Professor T. G.
Bonney found several flies in the Glacière de Chapuis.
Three of them were specimens of <i>Stenophylax</i>, the largest
being probably, but not certainly, <i>S. hieroglyphicus</i> of Stephens.
Two smaller caddis flies were either <i>S. testaceus</i>
of Pictet or some closely allied species. One other insect
was an ichneumon of the genus <i>Paniscus</i>, of an
unidentified species. It differed from all its congeners
in the marking of the throat, resembling in this respect
some species of <i>Ophion</i>. Mr. Browne thinks that the
case flies may have been washed into the cave somehow
or other in the larva form, and come to maturity on the
ice where they had lodged. But this explanation will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">« 217 »</a></span>
hold in the case of the ichneumon, which is a parasitic
genus on larvæ of terrestrial insects.</p>

but many stalactites and stalagmites of beautiful clear ice,
one of which resembled porcelain more than any other
substance. In August, Thury found an air current streaming
into the cave at the rear, but this did not, however,
disturb the air of the interior, for in one part it was in perfect
equilibrium: along the line of the draughts the ice was
more melted than elsewhere in the cave. In January, the

<p>Professor Thury&rsquo;s winter excursions caused him to
accept as proved that part of the mountaineers&rsquo; belief,
which holds that there is no ice formed in caves in winter.
One of the main grounds for his opinion was the series of
observations he made in the Glacière de Saint-Georges.
He found no ice forming there in winter and the natives
said it did not because the cavern was not cold enough.
So he placed large dishes filled with water in the cave and
found that they froze solid during the night, which he had
been assured was impossible. Thury also found violent
movements of the air at Saint-Georges in January, 1858.
A candle burned steadily for some time, but at 7.16 P. M.
it began to flicker and soon inclined downwards through
an angle of about 45&deg;; and in the entrance, the flame
assumed an almost horizontal position. At 8 P. M., the
current of air nearly disappeared. Thury thought that this
violent and temporary disturbance of equilibrium was due
to the fact that as the heavier air outside tended to pass
into the cave, the less cold air within tended to pass out;
and the narrow entrance confining the struggle to a small
area, the weaker current was able for a while to hold its
own.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">The Petite Glacière du Pré de Saint-Livres.</span>
(Browne, <i>Ice Caves</i>, page 46.)&mdash;This is near the last cave
at a slightly higher altitude. There is first a small pit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">« 221 »</a></span>
then a little cave, in which there is an ice slope. This
passes under a low arch in the rock wall, and leads down
into another small cave. Mr. Browne descended this ice
stream, which was itself practically a fissure column and
spread into the fan shape at the base. The lower cave
was 22 meters long and 11 meters wide, and contained an
ice floor and several fissure columns.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">The Glacière de Naye, above Montreux, Switzerland.</span>
(E. A. Martel, <i>Les Abimes</i>, page 397; <i>Spélunca</i>,
1895, vol. I., pages 107, 108; <i>Mémoires de la Société de
Spéléologie</i>, vol. III., pages 246-254.)&mdash;This is called a <i>glacier
souterrain</i>. It was discovered in 1893 by Professor
Dutoit. There are fifty-four caves known among the
Rochers de Naye, and only this one contains ice. It is a
long narrow cave with two entrances and widest towards
the base, which opens over a precipice. The altitude is
high, the upper entrance being at an altitude of 1820
meters, and the lower of 1750 meters. The place is both
a passage cave and a windhole. The snow falls into the
upper entrance, and slides down, becoming ice in the
lower portion. There are other connecting passages and
hollows where the cold air cannot get in, and there ice
does not form. Mons. Martel thinks that the ice formed
during the winter is preserved by the draughts&mdash;due to
the difference in level of the two openings&mdash;causing an
evaporation and chill sufficient for the purpose.</p>

meters wide.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">The Glacière de Monthézy.</span> (Browne, <i>Ice Caves</i>, page

de Travers and the Val de Brévine, on the path between the
villages of Couvet and Le Brévine, at an altitude of 1100
meters. The cave is nearly oval in shape, with a length of
34 meters and a width of 29 meters. The roof is from
1 meter to 3 meters high. There are three pits, about
20 meters deep, on different sides of the cave. The
descent is made through the largest pit. On the 6th of
July, 1864, Mr. Browne found the floor of the cave covered
with ice, and icicles and columns in some places;
he also saw a clump of cowslips (<i>primula elatior</i>) overhanging
the snow at the bottom of the pit through which
he descended.</p>

cave first rises, then sinks again below the level of the
entrance, where the ice begins. The cave is about 20
meters wide. About 180 meters were explored, to a point
where a perpendicular ice wall, 6 meters high, barred
the way. About 125 meters from the entrance, there was
an ice cone about 7 meters high.</p>

some valuable data in connection with the Nixloch. In
August, 1879, he found the air current entering downwards;
on September 14th, 1879, there was no current
either way. On Christmas day, 1878, on the contrary, the
draughts were reversed, pouring out of the hole with a
temperature of +7.4&deg;: the outside air then being -7.4&deg;.
At this time the known lower opening was in existence.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">The Kolowratshöhle.</span> Described in Part I., <a href="#Page_18">page 18</a>.
(Fugger, <i>Beobachtungen</i>, etc., page 7.)&mdash;This cavern has
been more carefully studied than any other glacière cave.
Some of its dimensions are given by Professor Fugger as
follows: From the entrance to the ice floor, 26.6 meters;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">« 227 »</a></span>
surface covered by ice as measured on a plane, 2940
square meters; approximate cubical measure of entire cave,
92,000 cubic meters. The height of the entrance is 7
meters, with a width at the base of 2.7 meters, and at the
top of 6.6 meters.</p>

<p>On the entrance slope occurred the only fatal accident
I know of in glacières. In 1866, the Bavarian minister
Freiherr von Lerchenfeld tried to descend; a wooden
handrail which had been erected over the snow broke
under his weight; von Lerchenfeld fell to the bottom of
the cave and died a few days after from the injuries he
received.</p>

<p>Of the Kolowratshöhle, we have numerous thermometric
observations by Professor Fugger, of which I select a few.</p>

over the Mitterkaser and the Sandkaser. In front
of the entrance is a sort of rock dam, 30 meters long and
5 meters or 6 meters higher than the entrance. Masses
of snow fill the space between the two. The entrance is
about 20 meters wide and from 2 meters to 3 meters high.
A snow slope of 25 meters in length, set at an angle of 25&deg;,
leads to the ice floor. The cave is 54 meters long, from
13 meters to 22 meters broad and from 4 meters to 10

Fugger, who has always found most snow and ice in the
beginning of the hot weather, after which it gradually
dwindles away.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">« 232 »</a></span>
glacière cave is the account of a visit to the Oetscher Caves
in 1591. After lying in manuscript for two and a half
centuries, it was published by Dr. A. Schmidl in 1857, in
<i>Die Höhlen des Ötscher</i>, pages 21-36. According to the
account, which is naive, but evidently truthful, Kaiser
Rudolf II. ordered Reichard Strein, owner of the Herrschaff
Friedeck, to investigate the Ötscher and especially its
caves. He did so, with the title of <i>Kaiserlicher Commissarius</i>,
and accompanied by the <i>Bannerherr</i> Christoph
Schallenberger, Hans Gasser, and eleven porters. On
September the 16th, 1591, they visited the Seelücken,
where they found a lake in the front of the cave, and
where the party had great difficulties in climbing round
on to the ice.</p>

<p>The Seelücken on the Oetscher is situated at an altitude
of 1470 meters. It opens nearly due south. The
ice floor is about 20 meters below the entrance and is
about 38 meters long and 24 meters wide; at the
rear, it rises for some 15 meters as an ice wall at an
angle of about 60&deg;, and then forms a second ice floor
about 45 meters long by 19 meters wide. The front part
of the ice is sometimes, about July, covered with water.
The cave continues further back, in two branches, and
Professors Cranmer and Sieger consider that it is a large
windhole, in which draughts are infrequent, on account
of its length and because the openings are near the
same level. There are also several up and down curves
and in these cold air remains and acts something like
a cork in stopping draughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">« 233 »</a></span></p>

on the 31st of May, 1896. The rates at which the ice
formed or melted, however, were not always the same in
different parts of the cave. The greatest amount of ice
observed seems to have been in March and April. In the
summer months no perceptible movements of air seem to
have been noticed. This was also sometimes the case in
the winter months, during which, however, movements of
air were at other times plainly perceptible.</p>

(Valvasor, <i>Die Ehre des Herzogthumes Crain</i>, vol. I., pages
242, 243; Hacquet, <i>Oryctographia Carniolica</i>, 1778, III.,
page 159.)&mdash;In the neighborhood of Vishnagora in the
Krain. The entrance is under a church. It is a large
cave, 40 meters long and 20 meters high, where the ice
all melts by the end of the summer. Valvasor gives the
following account of this cave in 1689, which seems the
first printed notice of a glacière in German:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near to Lazchenberg up by the church of St. Nicholas,
where a <i>Thabor</i> stands, one finds a big hole, which
sinks into the stony rocks. Through this one descends
deep with torches: there opens then underneath as big a
cavity as the biggest church could be, and the same is extremely
high, in the form of a cupola. One sees there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">« 239 »</a></span>
different teeth, formed and hardened from the water turned
to stone. Further down one arrives to a deep gully: into
which, however, I have not been. On the other side one
must again ascend, and then one comes again to a cupola:
in which cupola ice stands up like an organ from the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There also one sees icicles of pure ice of different
sizes and heights, of which many are one or two <i>klafters</i>
high and as thick as a man; but many only two or three
spans high or higher, and as thick as an arm, and some also
thinner. This ice is formed from the drops of falling
water; and indeed in summer; for in winter there is no
ice therein. Over such ice one must then ascend, as
there are then said to be separate holes and grottoes.
But no one has been any further.&rdquo;</p>

Meierhof Rosseck. Small glacière cave.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Gorge near Rosseck.</span> (Valvasor, <i>Die Ehre des Herzogthumes
Crain</i>, vol. I., page 243 and page 517 ; Petruzzi
in Haidinger&rsquo;s <i>Berichte</i>, etc., vol. VII., page 64.)&mdash;Behind
the ruined castle of Rosseck, on the Pograca Mountain
in the Krain, is a gorge, at whose bottom are four little
holes containing ice most of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">« 240 »</a></span></p>

<p>Valvasor wrote of this cave in 1689: &ldquo;Near Rosseck
immediately back of the castle there opens a mighty cavern
entirely in stony rock, and yawns in the shape of a cauldron
down into the earth. Above as wide as a good rifle
shot, but below quite narrow. And there underneath
there are many holes where the ice remains through the
whole summer. From such ice have Duke Frederick Graf
and Duke von Gallenberg daily made use in summer to
cool their wine. Six years ago I descended there in the
month of August, and found ice enough in all the holes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same volume Freiherr Valvasor elaborates his
remarks about this cave and that at Latzenberg, repeating
in the main the observations in the paragraph just given.
He says: &ldquo;There hang also long icicles which are quite
pleasant to look at. *  *  * This ice breaks all too easily
and quickly. *  *  * Contrarywise, however, this ice lasts
much longer in the sun and the heat than other ice. *  *  *
Some might think it would eventually turn into stone: this,
however, does not happen: for it remains only in summer
and disappears in winter: as I can say for certain, as I have
been in myself in the winter as well as in the summer time.
*  *  * For as in the summer the floor is quite covered
with ice: it makes walking so dangerous and bad that one
cannot take a step without climbing irons; but in the winter
time one goes safely and well. *  *  *&rdquo;</p>

<p>Freiherr Valvasor was evidently an accurate observer,
and, if for his word &ldquo;winter&rdquo; we substitute &ldquo;autumn,&rdquo; his
account will be much more nearly correct than might have
been expected two centuries ago.</p>

<i>Berichte</i>, etc., vol. VII., pages 65, 66.)&mdash;This is known also
as the Töplitzer, Unterwarmberger or Ainödter Grotto. It
lies 2 kilometers from Kuntschen, and 12 kilometers from
Töplitz near Neustädtel, in the Krain. Altitude about 630
meters. Petruzzi says: &ldquo;Of all so far noticed ice grottoes
it is the most wonderful and splendid.&rdquo; In August and
September, 1849, the temperatures near the ice were about
two degrees above freezing. On the 16th of August, there
were many long ice stalagmites and stalactites; on the
29th of September they had diminished materially. Petruzzi
says also: &ldquo;One leaves the abundant vegetation of the
Alpine summer flora, and through bushes and dwarf underbrush,
through bare and half moss covered rocks and
débris, through rotten and twisted tree stems, one comes
to the hall of eternal winter, where the microscopic mosses
of the north surround the thousand year old stalactites,
hanging from the dripping vault, with an always passing,
always freshly forming, tender sulphur colored down.&rdquo;
Dr. Schwalbe has also examined this cave.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">« 246 »</a></span>
lies in the Bihar Mountains, three hours from the village
of Ober-Girda, which can be reached from Gyula Fehérvar,
via Topánfalva. It is a pit cave, in limestone, at an altitude
of 1127 meters. The pit is about 57 meters broad,
and 45 meters deep, with exceedingly steep walls. The
entrance is in the northeast wall and is about 10 meters
high. This leads into a nearly circular hall 47 meters in
diameter and about 20 meters high. The floor is ice. In
the southeast corner is a hole over 75 meters deep. In
the northwest wall is an opening 14 meters wide, which
forms the beginning of a sort of gallery 54 meters long
and which at its further end is 24 meters wide and 8 meters
high. This is also covered with a flooring of ice, which in
some places can only be descended by step cutting. This
passage is also richly adorned with ice stalactites and stalagmites.
At its end is another also nearly circular hall,
21 meters in diameter and about 22 meters high. This
is called the &lsquo;<i>Beszerika</i>&rsquo; or church. In one place there
is a magnificent collection of ice stalagmites called the
&ldquo;Altar.&rdquo; Peters found in dirt on the sides of the cave
remains of bats not very different from those now living
in the vicinity. He thinks the bats may have come there
before the cave became a glacière; or else that they
may even now sometimes get into the first hall and there
perish from cold. This makes it uncertain, therefore,
whether the remains can be considered as of the past
or the present.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia <i>Evening Bulletin</i>, March, 1st, 1899,
printed the following note about Dóbsina: &ldquo;In this cave,
some sixteen years ago, a couple named Kolcsey elected
to pass the week immediately following their marriage.
They took with them a plentiful supply of rugs, blankets
and warm clothing, but notwithstanding all precautions,
their experience was not of a sufficiently pleasant nature
to tempt imitators.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Lednica of Szilize.</span> (M. Bel, <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
London, 1739, vol. XLI., page 41 <i>et seq.</i>; Townson,
<i>Travels in Hungary</i>, 1797; Terlanday, <i>Petermann&rsquo;s Mittheilungen</i>,
1893, page 283.)&mdash;It lies 1.5 kilometers from the
village of Szilize, near Rosenau, in Gomör County, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">« 254 »</a></span>
Carpathians, at an altitude of 460 meters. A pit about 35
meters deep, 75 meters long, and 48 meters wide opens in
the ground, and at the southern end, in the perpendicular
wall, is the cave. The entrance is 22 meters wide, 15
meters high, and faces north. A slope 4 meters long sinks
with an angle of 35&deg; to the floor of the cave, which is nearly
circular in form, with a diameter of about 10 meters. On
the east side of the cave there seems to be a hole in the
ice some 10 meters deep.</p>

<p>In 1739, there was published in London a curious letter
in Latin from Matthias Bel, a Hungarian <i>savant</i>, about the
cavern of Szilize. He says: "The nature of the cave has
this of remarkable, that, when outside the winter freezes
strongest, inside the air is balmy: but it is cold, even icy,
when the sun shines warmest. As soon as the snow
melts and spring begins, the inner roof of the cave,
where the midday sun strikes the outside, begins to
sweat clear water, which drops down here and there;
through the power of the inner cold it turns to transparent
ice and forms icicles, which in thickness equal
large barrels and take wonderful shapes. What as water
drops from the icicles to the sandy floor, freezes up,
even quicker, than one would think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The icy nature of the cave lasts through the whole
summer, and what is most remarkable, it increases with the
increasing heat of the sun. In the beginning of the spring
the soft winter&rsquo;s warmth begins to give way soon thereafter,
and when spring is more advanced, the cold sets in,
and in such a manner, that the warmer does the (outside)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">« 255 »</a></span>
air grow, the more does the cave cool off. And when the
summer has begun and the dog days glow, everything
within goes into icy winter. Then do the drops of water
pouring from the roof of the cave change into ice, and with
such rapidity that where to-day delicate icicles are visible,
to-morrow masses and lumps, which fall to the ground,
appear. Here and there, where the water drips down the
walls of the cave, one sees wonderful incrustations, like an
artificial carpeting. The rest of the water remains hanging
on the ice, according to the warmth of the day. For when
for a longer time it is warmer, the ice of the stalactites, of
the walls and of the floor increases; but when the ruling
heat, as sometimes happens, is diminished through north
winds or rainstorm, the waters freeze more slowly, the ice
drips more fully and begins to form little brooklets. When
however the temperature gets warmer, the icy nature of
the cave begins once more. Some have observed, that the
nature of the grotto receives the changes of temperature
ahead, like a barometer. For, when a warmer temperature
sets in outside, the waters change into ice, several
hours before the heat sets in, while the opposite takes
place, when by day the temperature is colder; for then
even by the warmest sky the ice begins to melt noticeably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the dog days have passed and the summer
has already changed into fall, the cave with its own nature
follows the conditions of the external air. In the early
months and while the nights are growing colder, the ice
diminishes visibly; then when the air cools off more and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">« 256 »</a></span>
more and when the brooks and side are rigid with frost, it
begins to melt as though there was a fire built underneath,
until, when winter reigns, it is entirely dry in the cave,
without a sign of ice being left behind. Then gentle
warmth spreads into the entire cave, and this icy grave
becomes a safety resort for insects and other small animals,
which bear the winter with difficulty. But besides
swarms of flies and gnats, troops of bats and scores of
owls, hares and foxes take up their abode here, until with
the beginning of spring, the cave once more assumes its
icy appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These assertions of Bel are the most inaccurate ones
made about glacières. Yet, strange to say, they have colored
the literature of the subject down to our own times;
and have been repeated many times, sometimes with,
sometimes without, the hares and foxes; the latest repetition
seeming to occur in 1883.</p>

gullies, but their water supply seems to come from a
cause which is not usually present in gorges. Their
principal observer, M. de Dittmar, thought that a cold
and snowy winter would add materially to the supply of
ice, but he also thought that a necessity to the existence
of the ice in these troughs was an abundant water supply
from a spring, whose temperature should be so high as
not to freeze in winter. The cold is supplied by the

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Cave of Yeermallik.</span> (Burslem, <i>A peep into Toorkisthan</i>,
1846, chaps. X., XI.)&mdash;In the valley of the Doaub,
northwest of Kabul. The entrance is half way up a hill,
and is about 15 meters wide and 15 meters high. This is
a large cave, with many ramifications and galleries. In
the centre of a hall far within, Captain Burslem found a
mass of clear ice, smooth and polished as a mirror, and
in the form of a beehive, with its dome-shaped top just
touching the long icicles which depended from the
jagged surface of the rock. A small aperture led into
the interior of this cone, whose walls were about 60
centimeters thick and which was divided into several
compartments. Some distance from the entrance of this
cave there is a perpendicular drop of 5 meters. A short
distance beyond this, in one of the halls, were hundreds of
skeletons of men, women and children, in a perfectly undisturbed
state, also the prints of a naked human foot and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">« 262 »</a></span>
the distinct marks of the pointed heel of an Afghan boot.
The moollah, who was acting as guide, said the skeletons
were the remains of seven hundred men of the Huzareh
tribe who took refuge in the cave with their wives and
children during the invasion of Genghis Khan, and who
defended themselves so stoutly, that after trying in vain to
smoke them out, the invader built them in with huge natural
blocks of stone, and left them to die of hunger. Some
of the Afghans said that the cave was inhabited by
Sheitan, a possibility denied by the moollah who guided
Captain Burslem, on the philosophical plea that the cave
was too cold for such an inhabitant.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Glacière Cave of Amarnath.</span> (Miss Mary Coxe of
Philadelphia showed me a copy of a letter of Dr. Wilhelmine
Eger describing a visit to this cave.)&mdash;It lies three
days&rsquo; journey from Pailgam in Kashmere, on the borders
of Little Tibet. The altitude is evidently high as one
crosses snow fields to get to it. A small path zigzagging
up a grassy slope leads to the cave and is a stiff climb
from the valley. The cave opens on the side of a mountain
and has a large, almost square mouth at least as big
as the floor area within. The floor of the cave is the continuation
of the grass slope and slants upwards and backwards
to the back wall, the only case of the kind so far
reported. This cave is most curiously connected with religion.
Dr. Eger says that there are two small blocks of
ice in it which never melt. From time immemorial these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">« 263 »</a></span>
blocks of ice have been sacred to the Hindoos who worship
them&mdash;as re-incarnations&mdash;under the names of Shiva
and Ganesh. Dr. Eger saw offerings of rice and flowers
on them. Thousands of pilgrims come every year at the
end of July or beginning of August from all parts of
India. Thousands of miles have been traversed and hundreds
of lives laid down through this journey. Every
year people die either before reaching the cave or after.
The trip from Pailgam in Kashmere takes three days up
and two days down, if one returns by a shorter route
where the way is unsafe because of avalanches. So many
have perished there that the pass is called &ldquo;The Way of
Death.&rdquo; This must be taken by one class of pilgrims,
<i>Sardhas</i> or Holy Men, to complete the sacred circuit,
but the Hindoos say any one dying on the pass will go
straight to heaven.</p>


<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Icicles Formed by Radiation.</span> (General Sir Richard
Strachey, <i>Geographical Journal</i>, 1900, vol. XV., page
168.)&mdash;On the Balch pass of the Balch range in Tibet,
General Strachey, in 1848, saw icicles of which he says:
"On the rocks exposed to the south were very curious
incrustations of ice, icicles indeed, but standing out horizontally
like fingers towards the wind. I was not able to
understand how they were caused, nor can I tell why they
were confined to particular spots. The thermometer stood
at 41&deg;[F.], and though the dew point at the time would
probably have been below 32&deg;[F.], and the cold produced
by evaporation sufficient therefore to freeze water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">« 264 »</a></span>
yet it is evident that no condensation could ever take
place simultaneously with the evaporation. *  *  * It
has since occurred to me that these icicles were formed
by radiation. I found, subsequently, in a somewhat similar
position, that a thermometer suspended vertically, and
simply exposed to the sky in front of it, was depressed as
much as 20&deg; F. below the true temperature of the surrounding
air. This result was, of course, due to the
radiation through the extremely dry and rarefied atmosphere
at the great elevation at which the thermometer
was exposed. As radiation takes place freely from a
surface of ice, the growth of such icicles as those described
might be due to the condensation of vapour brought up
by the southerly day winds that so constantly blow over
these passes, and its accumulation in the form of ice on
the exposed extremity of the icicle, the temperature of
which might thus have been greatly reduced."</p>

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Ice Formed by Radiation.</span> (T. A. Wise, <i>Nature</i>,
vol. V., page 189; R. H. Scott, <i>Elementary Meteorology</i>,
Third Ed., pages 61, 62.)&mdash;Mr. Bunford Samuel called
my attention to the mode of manufacturing ice by radiation
in India. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very practical use of nocturnal radiation has been
made from time immemorial in India in the preparation
of ice, and on such a scale that about 10 tons of ice can
be procured in a single night from twenty beds of the
dimensions about to be given, when the temperature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">« 265 »</a></span>
the air is 15&deg; or 20&deg; [F.] above the freezing point.
*  *  * The locality referred to is the immediate
neighborhood of Calcutta. A rectangular piece of ground
is marked out, lying east and west, and measuring 120
by 20 feet. This is excavated to the depth of two feet
and filled with rice straw rather loosely laid, to within six
inches of the surface of the ground. The ice is formed
in shallow dishes of porous earthenware, and the amount
of water placed in each is regulated by the amount of ice
expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cold weather, when the temperature of the air
at the ice fields is under 50&deg;, ice is formed in the dishes.
The freezing is most active with N. N. W. airs, as these
are driest; it ceases entirely with southerly or easterly
airs, even though their temperature may be lower than
that of the N. N. W. wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ice is formed if the wind is sufficiently strong to
be called a breeze, for the air is not left long enough at
rest, above the bed, for its temperature to fall sufficiently,
by the action of radiation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rice straw, being kept loose and perfectly dry,
cuts off the access of heat from the surface of the ground
below it, and, when the sun goes down, the straw being a
powerful radiator, the temperature of the air in contact
with the dishes is reduced some 20&deg; below that prevailing
some two or three feet above them. The rapid evaporation
of the water into the dry air above creates also an
active demand for heat to be rendered latent in the formation
of steam, and the result of all these agencies is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">« 266 »</a></span>
formation of ice, under favorable circumstances, on the
extensive scale above mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

Farnum and George L. Farnum, of Philadelphia, inform me
that they saw a small cave containing ice on the banks of
one of the Korean rivers. It is about 75 kilometers from
Seoul, nearly northeast, near the ferry where the old road
leading from Seoul towards northern Korea crosses the
Han Gang, the river which passes by Seoul. The entrance
is small; perhaps 2 meters wide. The cave is not
thoroughly explored. Ice lies near the entrance, and as
far back as the Messrs. Farnum could see.</p>

<p class="pmt2"><span class="smcap">Glacière Lava Cave near Shoji.</span> (<i>Evening Telegraph,
Philadelphia, January 2d, 1896.</i>)&mdash;The cave is about 12
kilometers from Shoji, and is in lava. First there is a pit
in the forest, some 5 meters wide by 15 meters deep. The
cave opens into this. It seems to be some 400 meters
long and from 2 meters to 12 meters high. There is an
ice floor in places, also many ice stalagmites. At the
furthest point reached there is a strong air current, which
extinguishes torches and so far has prevented further exploration.
Ice from the cave has been cut by the country
people for sale at Kofu, which is not far distant.</p>

<p class="pmt2">J. N. Nagel, a Vienna mathematician, visited the

in winter and preserved in summer as in an ice house.</p>


<p class="pmt2">M. de Cossigny wrote, in 1750, about Chaux-les-Passavant.
He made a plan of the cave and took many observations
in April, August and October, and concluded
that the interior condition of the cave does not change
noticeably from winter to summer, no matter what the
external conditions of temperature may be; that what
people say of greater cold in summer, vanishes before
actual experience and that, as a state of freezing reigns
more or less continuously in the cave, it is not surprising
if the ice accumulates. Apparently he was the first to
notice and insist on the necessity of drainage to the cave
through cracks in the rocks. He also made a series of
observations disproving those of M. de Billerez, as to the
presence of any kinds of salts in the rocks or ice.</p>

says: &ldquo;This ice is formed by the drops of water which
fall from the roof, and which freeze because of the chill
of the cave. In the winter there is no ice, but running
water.&rdquo; He says nothing, however, about the ice forming
in summer.</p>


<p class="pmt2">The <i>Citoyen</i> Girod-Chantrans visited Chaux-les-Passavant
in August, 1783, and reached the conclusion, from all
he saw and heard, that the cave did not freeze in summer
nor thaw in winter, and that it was really a natural ice
house. He was aided by the notes of a neighboring
physician, Dr. Oudot, who had made observations in the
cave, and among others, had placed stakes of wood, on
the 8th of January, 1779, in the heads of the columns he
had found in the cave; and on the 22d of February, 1780,
had found these stakes completely covered with ice, forming
columns 30 centimeters in diameter.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Hablizl, in 1788, wrote that the ice in the cave near
Karassoubazar formed in the spring by the snows which
melt, run into the cave, and refreeze. He also thought
that there was less ice there in the fall than in the spring,
that it diminishes in July and August, and that the idea,
current in the neighborhood, of the formation of ice in
summer, is a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">« 273 »</a></span></p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Pierre Prévost, in 1789, gave an accurate
explanation of the formation of the ice in Chaux-les-Passavant.
He says: "Weighing carefully the local circumstances,
one discovers in truth a few causes of permanent
cold. But these causes seem rather suited to keep up a
great freshness or to diminish the heat of summer, than to
produce a cold such as that which reigns in the cavern.
First of all, big trees throw shade over the entrance; it is,
I was told, forbidden under severe penalties to cut down
any of them, for fear of depriving the grotto of a necessary
shelter. In the second place, this entrance is situated
almost due north, leaning a little to the east, which is the
coolest exposure one can choose, and the one most suited
to help the effect of the icy winds which blow from that
quarter. Finally the slope is steep and the grotto deep
and covered with a thick vault. These three conditions
united constitute, as it seems to me, a very good <i>ice house</i>;
by which I mean a reservoir fit to preserve during the
summer, the ice which may bank up in winter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how does this ice bank up? One knows that
the outside waters above form on the roof, during the winter,
long drops and stalactites of ice. These icicles, which
hang down and increase constantly by the drip from the
same source which formed them, fall at last, carried away
by their own weight, and form so many centres, around
which freeze the waters with which the floor of the grotto
is always inundated. At the same time, the blowing of
the north wind accumulates snow at the base of the slope,
which is uncovered in part and exposed above to all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">« 274 »</a></span>
vicissitudes of the weather. Thus during the winter is
formed an irregular heap of ice and snow, which the first
heats of spring begin to make run, but which the heats of
summer cannot finish dissolving. The winter following
has therefore even more facility to augment the mass of
these ice pyramids, which have resisted until the fall. And
if men did not work at diminishing it, it might happen that
it would fill the entire cavern at last to a great height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am therefore strongly inclined to think that the
process of nature is here precisely similar to that of art;
that without any especial cause of cold, the natural glacière
of Besançon conserves in the moderate temperature
of deep caverns, the heaps of snow and ice which the
winds and the outside waters accumulate there during
the winter; and that the melting of these snows and of
these accumulated ices forms little by little the ice floor,
scattered over with blocks and pyramids, which one observes
there during the summer.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Horace Bénédict de Saussure, the great Swiss scientist
and mountaineer, in 1796, published a number of observations
about cold current caves in various parts of the
Alps. He found that in summer the air blows outward
at the lower end, and that in winter it draws inward. His
explanation is that in summer the colder air in the tube is
heavier than the outside air and displaces it by gravity;
while in winter the rupture takes place in the other direction,
since the column within the tube is warmer than the
outside air and therefore is pushed upwards by the heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">« 275 »</a></span>
air flowing in. He concludes that evaporation due to the
air passing internally over moist rocks suffices to explain
the phenomenon of low temperatures and that such caves
have a rather lower temperature in the Alps than in Italy
owing to the greater natural cold of the Swiss lake region.
An experiment of his is worth mentioning. He passed a
current of air through a glass tube, 2.5 centimeters in
diameter, filled with moistened stones, and found that the
air current which entered with a temperature of 22.5&deg;
came out with a temperature of 18.75&deg;, that is with a loss
of 3.75&deg; of heat.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Robert Townson, LL.D., in 1797, published an account,
perhaps the first in English, of a glacière cave.
He says of Szilize: "Ice I truly found here in abundance,
and it was mid-summer, but in a state of thaw; the bed of
ice, which covered the floor of the cavern was thinly covered
with water and everything announced a thaw. I had
no need to use my thermometer: however I placed it in
the ice and it fell to 0&deg; of Réaumur: I then wiped it and
placed it in a niche in the rock, at the furthest part of the
cavern, a yard above the ice and here it remained near an
hour: when I returned I found it at 0&deg;. *  *  * Everything
therefore, ice, water and atmosphere in the neighborhood
had the same temperature, and that was the temperature
of melting ice: 0&deg; Réaumur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When then is the ice which is found here, and in
such quantities that this cavern serves the few opulent
nobility in the neighborhood as an ice house, formed?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">« 276 »</a></span>
Surely in winter, though not by the first frost, not so soon
as ice is formed in the open air. No doubt, from the
little communication this cavern has with the atmosphere,
it will be but little and slowly affected by the change.
Should therefore, Mr. Bel, or any of his friends, have
come here to verify the common report at the commencement
of a severe frost, when the whole country was covered
with ice and snow, they might still have found
nothing here but water, or the ice of the preceding winter
in a state of thaw, and the cavern relatively warm; and
likewise, should they have visited it in a warm spring,
which had succeeded to a severe winter, they might have
found nothing here but frost and ice; and even the fresh
melted snow, percolating through the roof of this cavern,
might again have been congealed to ice. I observed frequently
in Germany in the severe winter of 1794-5, on a
sudden thaw, that the walls of churches and other public
buildings, on the outside were white and covered with a
hoar frost, and the windows on the same side covered
with a rime.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. Franz Sartori, in 1809, was a strong believer in the
summer ice theory, and wrote of the flies and the gnats,
the bats and the owls, and the foxes and the hares coming
to Szilize to winter.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Alexander von Humboldt, in 1814, says about the Cueva
del Hielo on the Peak of Teneriffe that so much snow
and ice are stored up in winter that the summer heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">« 277 »</a></span>
cannot melt it all, and also adds that permanent snow in
caves must depend more on the amount of winter snow,
and the freedom from hot winds, than on the absolute
altitude of the cave.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dewey, in 1819, thought that the ice in the Snow Glen
at Williamstown was a winter formation.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor M. A. Pictet visited Saint-Georges, Le Brezon
and Montarquis and in 1822 endeavored to prove that
they are cold current caves and that the ice in them is due
entirely to draughts causing evaporation. He believed in
the theory of the ice forming in summer more than in winter
and that it could not be the residue of a winter deposit.
He therefore argued that it must be due to descending
currents of air which he thought would be most energetic
in summer; that they would become at least as low as the
mean annual temperature of the place and be still further
cooled by evaporation. The strange thing about his theories
is that he does not seem to have personally observed
any draughts either at Saint-Georges or Le Brezon, but
the fact that the ice was evidently not an accumulation of
winter snow led him to try to reconcile what he had himself
seen with de Saussure&rsquo;s theories about windholes.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Jean André Deluc in 1822 published a paper discussing
the theories of MM. de Cossigny, Prévost and Pictet.
Deluc had never visited a glacière himself, but he explains
clearly the impossibility of Professor Pictet&rsquo;s cold current
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">« 278 »</a></span>
theory, on the simple ground that Professor Pictet himself
did not find any cold currents. He takes up Professor
Prévost&rsquo;s theories warmly; using also the manuscript
notes of Mons. Colladon who had visited the Grand Cave
de Montarquis. Deluc says: &ldquo;that the winter&rsquo;s cold penetrates
into these caves, freezes the water which collects
there and that the ice thus formed has not the time to
melt during the following summer.&rdquo; He says further:
&ldquo;It seems that in the three glacières with which we have
been occupied there is a flat or rather hollow bottom,
where the waters can form a more or less deep pond, and
whence they therefore cannot flow away; it is there they
flow in winter; and as these are shut in places where the
air cannot circulate, the heats of summer can only penetrate
very feebly. The ice once formed in such cavities, only
melts slowly; for one knows that ice in melting, absorbs
60&deg; of heat; and where find this heat in an air always very
cold and nearly still? During a great cold, the ice forms
with great promptness, while it melts with much slowness,
even when the temperature of the air is several degrees
above zero; what must then not be this slowness when
the temperature of the interior air only rises in summer
one degree above freezing point. It would need several
summers to melt this ice if it did not reform each winter.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">C. A. Lee, in 1825, wrote that the ice in the Wolfshollow
near Salisbury was a winter formation.</p>


<p class="pmt2">G. Poulett Scrope, in 1826, accepted as the truth the
statement that the cave of Roth was filled with ice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">« 279 »</a></span>
summer, but that it was warm during the winter. In 1827,
he explained the presence of ice at Pontgibaud as follows:
&ldquo;The water is apparently frozen by means of the powerful
evaporation produced by a current of very dry air issuing
from some long fissures or arched galleries which
communicate with the cave, and owing its dryness to the
absorbent qualities of the lava through which it passes.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">F. Reich, in 1834, thought that there were two possible
causes which might produce subterranean ice: 1, the difference
in specific gravity between warm and cold air; 2,
evaporation. He thought the cold air a sufficient cause in
most caves, but he considered that evaporation also played
a part not infrequently.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Silliman, in 1839, gave the first hint, in the
negative, about compressed air as a cause for subterranean
ice. He said about Owego that if one could suppose that
compressed gases or a compressed atmosphere were escaping
from the water or near it, this would indicate a
source of cold, but that as there is no indication of this
in the water, the explanation is unavailable.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor A. Pleischl wrote in 1841 that he was told
that ice formed on the Pleschiwetz and on the Steinberge
in summer. Continuing, he says: "The author is therefore,
as well as for other reasons, of the opinion, that
the ice is not remaining winter ice, but a summer
formation, and one formed by the cold of evaporation.

for the heat, and takes up therefore easily the sun&rsquo;s
warmth, but parts with it easily to other neighboring
bodies. In the hollows, between the basalt blocks, is
found, as I already mentioned, rotting moss, which forms
a spongy mass, which is wet through with water. The
basalt heated by the sun&rsquo;s rays now causes a part of
the water in the spongy mass to vaporize; for this
evaporation the water needs heat, which it withdraws
from the neighboring bodies and in part from water,
and makes the water so cold, that it freezes into ice, as,
under the bell of an air pump&mdash;Nature therefore makes
here a physical experiment on the largest scale."</p>

<p>Much stress appears to have been laid on the paper
of Professor Pleischl by Professor Krauss and one or two
others. The weak point in it is that Pleischl did not see
the ice form in summer, but was only, as usual, told that
it did so. There is nothing in the facts given to show
that the places mentioned are different from any other
taluses, where ice does not form as the result of heat.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. C. B. Hayden, in 1843, wrote about the Ice Mountain
in Virginia, and held that the porous nature of the
rocks makes them poor conductors of heat, and that the
mountain is a huge sandstone refrigerator.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. S. Pearl Lathrop, in 1844, wrote of the Ice Bed
at Wallingford, Vermont, as a great natural refrigerator.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Sir Roderick Impey Murchison wrote in 1845 about
the salt mine and freezing cave of Illetzkaya-Zatschita.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">« 281 »</a></span>
He visited them during a hot August, and was assured
that the cold within is greatest when the external air
is hottest and driest; that the fall of rain and a moist
atmosphere produce some diminution in the cold of the
cave and that on the setting in of winter the ice disappears
entirely. He accepted these statements evidently
only in a half hearted way, submitting them to Sir John
Herschel, who tried to explain them, in case they were
true, of which Herschel was likewise doubtful. Murchison
at first thought that the ice was due to the underlying
bed of salt, but soon recognized that this explanation
could not be correct. He also rejected Herschel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;heat and cold wave&rdquo; theory. Shortly after this he came
across Pictet&rsquo;s memoir, and on the strength of it concluded
that the ice in Illetzkaya-Zatschita could not be the residue
of a winter deposit, but must be due to descending currents
of air; to the previously wet and damp roof affording
a passage to water; and to the excessive dryness of
the external air of these southern steppes contributing
powerfully to the refrigerating effects of evaporation.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Arnold Guyot, in 1856, said that the well at
Owego admitted large quantities of snow which melts, but
not readily, because it is not accessible to the sun. It
therefore goes through the same process as glaciers, of
partly melting and refreezing; and we have the formation
of a glacier without movement.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor W. B. Rogers, in 1856, held that the well at
Owego became the recipient of the coldest air of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">« 282 »</a></span>
neighborhood, and the temperature remained abnormal
because the bad conducting power of the materials of
the well retained the cold.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor D. Olmstead, in 1856, held about Owego
that cold air exists in the interior of the earth which may
have found a ventilating shaft in the well.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Petruzzi, in 1857, considered the following
requirements necessary for a glacière: A high altitude
above the sea; a decided drop into the interior of the
mountain; absence of all draught; protection against all
warm and moist winds, therefore the opening to north
and east. He also says about the glacière on the Pograca:
that it is in shadow; that the thick forest round the mouth
keeps the temperature down; that it begins to freeze
below when it does above; that the cold remains there
into the spring; and that the water from rain or other
sources, which flows into the cave, must freeze there, and
the ice form in greater quantities than the heat of summer
can melt away.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. Albert D. Hager wrote in 1859: "The question
now arises, why it was that such a congealed mass of
earth was found in Brandon at the time the frozen well
was dug. My opinion is, that the bad conducting property
of the solids surrounding it, the absence of ascending
currents of heated air, and of subterranean streams of
water in this particular locality favored such a result; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">« 283 »</a></span>
that the bad conducting property of clay, as well as that
of the porous gravel associated with it, taken in connection
with the highly inclined porous strata, and the disposition
of heated air to rise, and the cold air to remain
below, contribute to produce in the earth, at this place, a
<i>mammoth refrigerator</i>, embracing essentially the same
principle as that involved in the justly celebrated refrigerator
known as 'Winship&rsquo;s Patent.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clay is not only nearly impervious to air and water,
but it is one of the worst conductors of heat in nature.
(<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;To test the question whether clay was a poor
conductor of heat or not, I took two basins of equal size,
and in one put a coating of clay one-half inch thick, into
which I put water of a temperature of 52&deg; Fahrenheit.
Into the other dish, which was clean, I put water of the
same temperature, and subjected the two basins to equal
amounts of heat; and in five minutes the water in the
clean dish indicated a temperature of 70&deg; while that of the
one coated with clay was raised only to 56&deg;.) If we can
rely upon the statements of those who dug out the frozen
earth, it rested upon a stratum of clay that lay upon the
bed of pebbles in which the water was found, for it was
described as being a very sticky kind of hard pan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This being the case, if the water contained in the
pebbly mass had a temperature above the freezing point,
the heat would be but imperfectly transmitted to the frost,
through the clay, provided there was no other way for its
escape. But we have seen that the stratum of clay that
overlays the bed of pebbles in the side of the gravel pit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">« 284 »</a></span>
was not horizontal, but inclined towards the well at an
angle of 25&deg;. Now if this drip was continued to the well,
and existed there (which is highly probable), it will be
seen that the ascending current of heated air, in the
pebbly bed, would be checked upon meeting the overlying
barrier of clay and be deflected out of its upward
course. The tendency of heated air is to rise, hence it
would continue its course along the under side of the
clay, through the interstices in the bed of pebbles, till it
found a place of escape at the surface, which in this case
may have been at the gravel pit before named.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Edward Hitchcock wrote in 1861: "The
presence of a mass of frozen gravel deep beneath the surface
in Brandon, was first made known by digging a well
in it in the autumn of 1858. *  *  * The gravel, also,
rises into occasional knolls and ridges. In short, it is just
such a region of sand and gravel as may be seen in many
places along the western side of the Green Mountains;
and indeed, all over New England. It is what we call
modified drift, and lies above genuine drift, having been
the result of aqueous agency subsequent to the drift
period. *  *  * The well was stoned up late in the
autumn of 1858, and during the winter, ice formed upon
the water in one night, two inches thick. It continued to
freeze till April; after which no ice was formed on the
surface, but we can testify that as late as June 25th, the
stones of the well for four or five feet above the surface
of the water were mostly coated with ice; nay, it had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">« 285 »</a></span>
wholly disappeared July 14th. The temperature of the
water was only one degree of Fahrenheit above freezing
point. The ice did however disappear in the autumn but
was formed again (how early we did not learn) in the
winter, and so thick too that it was necessary to send
some one into the well to break it. We visited the well
August 18th, 1860, and found the temperature 42&deg;. Yet
only the week previous ice was seen upon the stones, and
we were even told by one of the family, that a piece of ice
had been drawn up the day before in the bucket. *  *  *
These frozen deposits may have been produced during the
glacial period that accompanied the formation of drift, and
continued far down into the subsequent epochs of modified
drift. *  *  * But in all the excavations both gravel
and clay occur: and how almost impervious to heat must
such a coating 20 feet thick, be! It would not, however,
completely protect the subjacent mass from solar heat.
But there is another agency still more powerful for this
end, namely, evaporation, which we think has operated
here, as we shall more fully describe further on; and we
think that these two agencies, namely, non-conduction and
evaporation, may have preserved this frozen deposit for
a very long period, from exterior influences."</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Thury in 1861 says about Saint-Georges:
"Such is the <i>résumé</i>, concise but exact, of the results of
our winter excursion. They furnish proof to the fact generally
borne witness to by the mountaineers, that ice does
not form in winter in the interior of caverns. But if this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">« 286 »</a></span>
is so, it is for a very simple reason: two things are necessary
for the formation of ice: cold and water. In winter,
the cold is not wanting: but if there is no spring opening
in the cave, the water is absent, and then no ice forms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in the spring, at the time of the first melting of
the snows, that the ice must form. Then water at 0&deg;
pours over the surface, and penetrates by the fissures
of the rock and by the large openings into the chilled
cavern, which is also receiving the freezing air of the
nights. The grotto then makes its annual provision of
ice, which after this could only diminish little by little
during the whole duration of the warm season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Thury writes about the Grand Cave de Montarquis:
&ldquo;Here it must be when water and cold meet,
that is autumn and especially spring, the time of the first
melting of the snows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the winter *  *  * the colder, heavier air
comes to freeze the water of the grotto, and chill the ice
and the wall of rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the summer, the radiation of the vaults and
the proper heat of the ground only melt a small quantity
of ice because this absorbs much heat to pass into a liquid
state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The heat of the air is entirely used to melt the ice; it
does not therefore manifest itself as sensible heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The contact of the ice ready to melt, plays in a certain
way, towards the air a little warmer than itself, the rôle of
an extremely absorbing body, or one which has an excessive
caloric conductibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">« 287 »</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here the formation of the ice could not possibly be
attributed to the cold caused by evaporation. The psychrometer
indicated ninety-two per cent, of relative humidity:
the atmosphere of the grotto was therefore almost
saturated with evaporation of water, and the maximum of
cold caused by evaporation was not over half a degree
centigrade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About prismatic ice and a hollow pyramid, he says:
&ldquo;The prismatic (<i>aréolaire</i>) structure is produced later on
in the ice, by a new and particular arrangement of the
molecules of the already solidified water. Therefore the
recent stalactites are never crystallized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the beginning of the hot season, the atmospheric
temperature of the grotto rises slowly. Inferior to zero
by some tenths of a degree, it produces first on the surface,
in the stalactites, the prismatic structure. The temperature
continues to rise, the central portions of the stalactites,
still composed of ordinary ice, liquefy, and if the melting
water finds some issue, either by accidental openings left
between some prisms, or by the extremity of the stalactite
or by some point of its surface which had escaped the
action of the regular crystallization; by this opening the
water escapes, and the tubular stalactite has been formed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The column was composed of a very special ice, perfectly
dry, perfectly homogeneous, translucid and whose
appearance could only be compared to that of the most
beautiful porcelain. I am inclined to believe that we had
under our eyes a special molecular state of congealed
water. This state would be produced under the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">« 288 »</a></span>
of a constant temperature of a certain degree (<span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;perhaps
not far from 4&deg;&mdash;the actual temperature of the grotto)
long prolonged. These causes can be realized more completely
in glacières than anywheres else.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">The Reverend George Forrest Browne, published in
1865, <i>Ice Caves in France and Switzerland</i>, one of the most
delightful books of travel ever written, on account of the
scientific accuracy and the humor of the author. He visited
La Genollière, Saint-Georges, Saint-Livres, Chaux-les-Passavant,
Monthézy, Arc-sous-Çicon, the Schafloch, Haut-d&rsquo;Aviernoz,
which he calls Grand Anu, Chapuis, and Font-d&rsquo;Urle.
He says: "The view which Deluc adopted was
one which I have myself independently formed. *  *  *
The heavy cold air of winter sinks down into the glacières,
and the lighter warm air of summer cannot on ordinary
principles of gravitation dislodge it, so that heat is very
slowly spread in the caves; and even when some amount
of heat does reach the ice, the latter melts but slowly, for
ice absorbs 60&deg; C. of heat in melting; and thus, when ice is
once formed, it becomes a material guarantee for the permanence
of cold in the cave. For this explanation to hold
good it is necessary that the level at which the ice is formed
should be below the level of the entrance to the cave;
otherwise the mere weight of the cold air would cause it
to leave its prison as soon as the spring warmth arrived.
In every single case that has come under my observation,
this condition has been emphatically fulfilled. It is necessary,
also, that the cave should be protected from direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">« 289 »</a></span>
radiation, as the gravitation of cold air has nothing to do
with resistance to that powerful means of introducing heat.
This condition, also, is fulfilled by nature in all the glacières
I have visited, excepting that of S. Georges; and
there art has replaced the protection formerly afforded by
the thick trees which grew over the hole of entrance. The
effect of the second hole in the roof of this glacière is to
destroy all the ice which is within range of the sun. A
third and very necessary condition is, that the wind should
not be allowed access to the cave; for if it were, it would
infallibly bring in heated air, in spite of the specific weight
of the cold air stored within. It will be understood from
my description of such glacières as that of the Grand Anu,
of Monthézy, and the lower glacière of the Pré de S. Livres,
how completely sheltered from all winds the entrances to
those caves are. There can be no doubt, too, that the
large surfaces which are available for evaporation have
much to do with maintaining a somewhat lower temperature
than the mean temperature of the place where the
cave occurs."</p>

<p>Browne noticed prismatic ice several times. He says
of it: "M. Thury suggests also, as a possibility, what I
have found to be the case by frequent observations, that
the prismatic ice has greater power of resisting heat than
ordinary ice. *  *  * A Frenchman who was present in
the room in which the Chemical Section of the British
Association met at Bath, and heard a paper which I read
there on this prismatic structure, suggested that it was
probably something akin to the rhomboidal form assumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">« 290 »</a></span>
by dried mud; and I have since been struck by the great
resemblance to it, as far as the surface goes, which the pits
of mud left by the coprolite workers near Cambridge offer,
of course on a very large scale. This led me to suppose
that the intense dryness which would naturally be the result
of the action of some weeks or months of great cold
upon subterranean ice might be one of the causes of its
assuming this form, and the observations at Jena would
rather confirm than contradict this view: competent authorities,
however, seem inclined to believe that warmth,
and not cold, is the producing cause."</p>

<p>Mr. Browne found a hollow cone at La Genollière, for
which he accounted as follows: "In the loftier part of
the cave *  *  * ninety six drops of water in a minute
splashed on to a small stone immediately under the main
fissure. This stone was in the centre of a considerable
area of the floor which was clear of ice. *  *  * I found
that the edge of the ice round this clear area was much
thicker than the rest of the ice on the floor, and was
evidently the remains of the swelling pedestal of the
column. *  *  * When the melted snows of spring
send down to the cave, through the fissures of the rock,
an abundance of water at a very low temperature and the
cave itself is stored with the winter&rsquo;s cold, these thicker
rings of ice catch first the descending water, and so a
circular wall, naturally conical, is formed around the area
of stones; the remaining water either running off through
the interstices, or forming a floor of ice of less thickness,
which yields to the next summer&rsquo;s drops. In the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">« 291 »</a></span>
of time, this conical wall rises, narrowing always, till a
dome-like roof is at length formed and thenceforth the
column is solid." From what I have observed myself, this
explanation seems to fairly meet the facts.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor T. G. Bonney, in 1868, was inclined to believe
that there was some connection between glacières and a
glacial period.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. W. R. Raymond, in 1869, concluded from his own
observations about the lava cave in Washington: that the
cold air of winter freezes up the percolating waters from
the surface, layer upon layer, solid from the bottom,
and the accumulated ice thaws slowly in summer, being
retarded by the covering which keeps out the direct
rays of the sun, and by the fact that the melting ice at
one end of the cave, through which the summer draught
enters, itself refrigerates the air and maintains a freezing
temperature at the other end.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. C. A. White, in 1870, says of the cavern at Decorah:
&ldquo;The formation of the ice is probably due to the
rapid evaporation of the moisture of the earth and rocks,
caused by the heat of the summer sun upon the outer wall
of the fissure and valley side. This outer wall is from ten
to twenty feet in thickness where the ice was seen to be
most abundant. The water for its production seems to
be supplied by slow exudation from the inner wall of the
cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">« 292 »</a></span></p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. Krenner, in 1874, wrote of Dóbsina as &ldquo;a natural
ice cellar of giant dimensions, whose ice masses formed in
winter, the summer does not succeed in melting.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor W. Boyd Dawkins wrote in 1874: &ldquo;The
apparent anomaly that one only out of a group of caves
exposed to the same temperature should be a glacière,
may be explained by the fact that these conditions [those
formulated by the Rev. G. F. Browne] are found in combination
but rarely, and if one were absent there would be
no accumulation of perpetual ice. It is very probable that
the store of cold laid up in these caves, as in an ice house,
has been ultimately derived from the great refrigeration of
climate in Europe in the Glacial Period.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. Theodore Kirchhoff examined the lava caves in the
State of Washington and in 1876 wrote that he considered
that the ice in the smaller ones were simply remains of the
winter&rsquo;s cold. He thought that the ice in the large cave
where there is a draught could not be accounted for in the
same way, so he concluded that the ice must be due to the
draught.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. N. M. Lowe, in 1879, proposed the Compressed
Air or Capillary theory<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> about the Cave at Decorah.</p>

exposition of the theory in the same journal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">« 293 »</a></span></p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. Aden S. Benedict, in 1881, published his observations
about Decorah. He found that there was no water
falling in the cave to compress the air, that there was no
water falling near enough to be heard, nor any aperture
giving vent to cold air in the cave. He thought that the
cold of winter cools the sides of the cave several degrees
below freezing point and that these rocks are so far
underground that it would take a long season of hot
weather to raise this temperature to the melting point of
ice. In the spring the water percolates through the soil
and drips on to the yet freezing rocks; on which it freezes
and remains until the heat of summer penetrates to a sufficient
depth to melt it away. The rocks once raised above 0&deg;
remain so until the following winter and consequently if
there are heavy autumn rains there is water on the rocks
but no ice. Mr. Benedict concluded that there was nothing
more mysterious about Decorah than the fact that if
you drop water on a cold stone it will freeze.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Friederich Umlauft in 1883 wrote about
glacières "that as moreover they were generally protected
against warm winds and strong draughts and as their entrances
look towards the north or east, there is consequently
more ice formed under these conditions in winter
than can melt away in summer. Other ice grottoes however
show the remarkable characteristic, that it is warm in
them in winter, in the summer on the contrary it becomes
so cold that all the dripping water freezes. They are
found near snow clefts and gorges; when in the hot summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">« 294 »</a></span>
months the snow melts, then the cold which has become
free presses down the temperature in the cave so
much that the water freezes into ice. Such grottoes are
in Austria at *  *  * Frauenmauer, *  *  * Brandstein,
*  *  * Teplitz, *  *  * Scilize, *  *  * Dobschauer."</p>


<p class="pmt2">Herr Körber in 1885 wrote about the Schafloch, that the
stored-up winter&rsquo;s cold stands out as permanent adversary
of the higher temperature of the earth. The thermometer
proved this by its action at the end of the cave in a rock
cleft, which is warmer than the rest of the cave. In September
Herr Körber found the masses of ice less and the
stalagmites smaller than in January, especially a column
which in January had become a stately mountain of transparent
ice.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Eberhard Fugger of Salzburg, has studied
the caves of the Untersberg carefully, having paid over
eighty visits to them. He classifies freezing caverns into
the following types, according to their position and their
shape:</p>

<p>According to position: 1, open caves, that is those
whose entrance is free on a rock wall; 2, pit caves, where
the entrance is at the bottom of a pit; 3, pit caves, where
the pit is covered and the opening is in the roof.</p>

<p>According to shape: 1, <i>sackhöhlen</i> or chamber caverns,
into which one enters immediately at the entrance; 2,
<i>ganghöhlen</i>, or passage caves terminating in a chamber; 3,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">« 295 »</a></span>
<i>röhrenhöhlen</i>, or passage caves where the passages continue
further than the chamber.</p>

<p>He is a strong advocate of the winter&rsquo;s cold theory.
He says: &ldquo;The ice of caves is formed by the cold of
winter, and remains despite the heat of summer, as through
local circumstances the quantity of heat brought to the ice
is not great enough to melt it by the time when ice and
snow in the open at the same altitude have already disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In order that ice may form in a cave in winter, two
factors are necessary. There must be water present in
some form or other, and in some way the outside cold air
must be able to sink into the cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the bottom of a cave is below the entrance, the
outside cold winter air sinks into the cave from its weight,
when the temperature of the cave air is higher than that of
the outside air; and it will remain there during the warmer
weather, as the warm outside air on account of its lighter
weight cannot drive out the cold heavy cave air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most important factor for the formation of ice is
the drip water. The more drip flows into a cave during
the cold season, the more ice is formed; the more drip, on
the contrary, flows into the cave during the warm season,
the more ice is destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The warmth, which the roof of the cave gives out, is
also a cause which helps to melt the ice, and a cause in
fact which works the harder, the higher the temperature of
the roof and the dirtier the ice floor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If direct rays of the sun penetrate a cave, they scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">« 296 »</a></span>
warm up the air which they traverse, but they raise the
temperature of the floor or of the walls, which they touch.
They are therefore a very important factor, which may
bring about the melting of the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The snow slope at the mouth of a cave offers some
protection against the rays of the sun, especially if it is no
longer white, but covered with all sorts of dirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The larger the mass of ice, the longer is its duration.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A certain thickness to the roof is of importance in
preserving the ice. If it is less than 8 meters, then it is
well if it is covered with outside vegetation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I entirely agree with these <i>dicta</i> of Professor Fugger.</p>

<p>In 1893, Fugger writes: "The peculiar readings of
temperature, which I made in August 1877, in the Kolowratshöhle,
namely on the 13th at 12 M., 0.5&deg;, on the
15th at 4 P. M., 0.35&deg;, on the 23d at 10 A. M., 0.12&deg;, on the
26th at 10 A. M., 0.17&deg;, and on the 30th at 2.15 P. M.,
-0.10&deg;, I think I can attribute to the workings of the winds.
In the observations themselves there could scarce be an
error. All five observations were made at the same place,
with the same thermometer, after at least half an hour&rsquo;s
exposure. In the time from the 13th to the 30th of
August, the temperature minimum in the town of Salzburg,
was 12&deg;; before the 30th were several cloudless
nights. During the whole of August scarcely any but
southeast and northwest winds were blowing. The Kolowratshöhle
opens in a rock wall to the east; the above
named winds therefore affected during the entire month
the entrance to the cave and may have produced a lively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">« 297 »</a></span>
evaporation in the cave, through a sort of sucking up of
the cave air, and thus have created the rather decided
cooling off of 0.6&deg; within seventeen days."</p>

<p>This statement, coming from Professor Fugger, deserves
particular attention, because it would go to show:
first, that the air in the Kolowratshöhle, a <i>sackhöhle</i> with
only one entrance, is only apparently stagnant in summer
and not really so; and second, that evaporation may act
to a limited extent in a cavern where there is almost no
running water.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Captain Trouillet, in 1885, published a paper about
Chaux-les-Passavant. He found that when it was colder
inside than outside, the internal air was nearly cut off
from the outside; when it was coldest outside there was
a lively disturbance. He called these two classes <i>périodes
fermées</i> and <i>périodes ouvertes</i>. He says: &ldquo;The duration
of a <i>closed period</i> is measured then on the curves [of a
maximum and minimum thermometer] of the interior
temperatures, between a minimum and the following
maximum; that of an <i>open period</i> is between a minimum
and the preceding maximum. One can thus count from
the 25th November to the 31st December 25 <i>open periods</i> of
a total duration of 200 hours or 8 times 24 hours: which
gives for each a duration of 7-1/2 hours. The shortest
lasted 2 hours and the longest 16 hours. During the
same interval, the <i>closed periods</i> numbered 26, making a
total duration of about 28 days; the longest, which lasted
from the 3d to the 8th December, was 126 hours long.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">« 298 »</a></span></p>

<p>Trouillet also says: &ldquo;From the 23d to the 30th December,
the grotto was completely isolated from the external
air, and yet during three consecutive nights, the
interior had three marked chills. Such is the phenomenon
whose cause can only lay, in our opinion, in the introduction
of the dry air driven to the cave by the winds between
north and east. This air on entering comes in contact
with the ice and the humid roof of the cave; it saturates
itself in producing a formation of vapors, and therefrom
a consumption of heat which may be considerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are some discrepancies in this last paragraph
which must be noted, for the reason that Trouillet&rsquo;s observations
are so valuable. He does not mention having
seen the vapors himself, in fact the production of these
vapors seems only an inference. Nor is it easy to understand
how the grotto could be &ldquo;completely isolated from
the external air&rdquo; if the phenomenon lay &ldquo;in the introduction
of the dry air driven to the cave by the winds north
and east.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. B. Schwalbe, in 1886, wrote that &ldquo;all my observations
point to the fact that the rock is the cooling factor in
summer, and that the cold goes out from it.&rdquo; He says
also that "when I saw for the first time the little cave of
Roth, which was filled with fairly numerous ice formations,
it was precisely the smallness of the volume of air and the
strange appearance of the ice which made the simple cold
air theory seen insufficient, nor could I later, by widening
the theory and observing the localities from the basis of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">« 299 »</a></span>
DeLuc&rsquo;s theory, accept it. It always seemed by all my
observations that in the rock there must be a lasting
source of cold. There must be a cause present, which
prevents the rapid warming of the cave wall through the
temperature of the ground, which also keeps the stone
cool in summer and induces the main ice formation in the
spring." He also hints that Mr. Lowe&rsquo;s compressed air
theory may be the correct one. Dr. Schwalbe&rsquo;s work,
<i>Über Eishöhlen und Eislöcher</i>, is one of the four or five
most important contributions to glacière literature, and
his opinion is entitled to great respect on account of his
many observations.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Israel C. Russell wrote in 1890, about the ice
beds on the Yukon: &ldquo;It is thought by some observers,
to be an inheritance from a former period of extreme cold;
but under existing climatic conditions, when ice forms
beneath a layer of moss, it is preserved during the short
summer, and may increase as it does on the tundras, to
an astonishing thickness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1897, Professor Russell says: "It is not probable
that all the subsoil ice of northern regions has been
formed in one way. Along the flood plains and on the
deltas of rivers where layers of clear ice are interbedded
with sheets of frozen gravel and vegetable matter, as is
frequently the case, it seems evident that the growth of
the deposit is due, in some instances, to the flooding of
previously frozen layers, and the freezing and subsequent
burial of the sediment thus added to their surfaces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">« 300 »</a></span>
When spring freshets spread out sheets of débris over
the flood plain of a river, as frequently happens when
streams in high latitudes flow northward, the previously
frozen soil and the ice of ponds and swamps may be
buried and indefinitely preserved." &ldquo;There is still
another process by which frozen subsoil may be formed in
high latitudes: this is, the effects of the cold during the
long winters are not counteracted by the heat during the
short summers. Under the conditions now prevailing in
northern Alaska, where the mean annual temperature is
below 32&deg; Fahrenheit, the frozen layer tends to increase
the thickness from year to year just as the depth of frozen
soil in more temperate latitudes may increase from month
to month during the winter season. During the short
northern summers, especially where the ground is moss
covered, melting only extends a few inches below the surface.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mons. E. A. Martel, in 1892, wrote of the Creux-Percé:
&ldquo;I incline only, as in all the pits which narrow at
the bottom (<i>avens à rétrécissement</i>) to attribute the chilling
to the fall of the cold air of winter and to its non-renewal
in summer.&rdquo; And at page 564 of <i>Les Abimes</i> he says:
"One knows that <i>evaporation</i> is an active cause of cooling;
therefore it is always cooler in caves near the drips
of water. *  *  * I have positively noted this influence
of evaporation near the drips of Tabourel (8&deg; instead of
9.5&deg;), of Dargilan, of the Cerna Jama, and in abysses with
double mouths where there were strong draughts (Rabanel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">« 301 »</a></span>
Biau, Fosse-Mobile, etc.)." In December, 1897,
Mons. Martel writes: &ldquo;In short, the action of the winter&rsquo;s
cold is the real cause accepted by *  *  * and recently
confirmed by Fugger, Trouillet and Martel.&rdquo; And also:
&ldquo;It is probable that this influence [evaporation] is only
real at rather high altitudes; this is at least what seems
the result of the studies of the caves of Naye (1700 to
1900 meters) begun by Professor Dutoit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1899, Mons. Martel gave an account of the Glacière
de Naye. In this paper, he abandons definitely fossil ice,
salts and the capillary theory as possible causes of underground
ice. He considers that there are four causes:
1, shape of the cavity; 2, free access of snow in winter;
3, high altitude; 4, evaporation due to wind currents.
The last two causes he thinks are not necessarily always
present. For instance he considers that, at the Creux-Percé,
and at Chaux-les-Passavant, the ice is due especially
to the sack or hour-glass shape of these hollows where
the summer air cannot get in on account of its lightness.
At the Glacière de Naye, which is a big windhole, situated
at an altitude of 1750 to 1820 meters, Mons. Martel thinks
that the ice is formed by the snow and cold of winter, but
that its preservation is assured by the evaporation caused
by the action of the windhole.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. Terlanday, in 1893, asserted that ice does not form
in Szilize in winter, and that the ice first forms in the winter
in the upper part of rock fissures and that in the
spring, at the time of an increase of temperature, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">« 302 »</a></span>
fissure ice is brought to the melting point by the successive
entering of heat into the earth and that it then arrives
at the cave, where it aids the formation of icicles. This
theory about fissure ice is probably in so far correct, that
the ice in the upper parts of fissures, near the surface of
the ground, melts before the ice in the lower parts of fissures.
The drip would then naturally run into the cave
and, as long as the temperature of the cave was low, help
to form cave ice.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Dr. Hans Lohmann, in 1895, published some valuable
notes about several glacières. While considering the cold
of winter as the main cause of the ice, he thought evaporation
a secondary cause of cold. He says: "That the
cold from evaporation bears its share in cooling a cave,
will not be denied. *  *  * The air saturated with
aqueous vapor makes one think of constant evaporation.
The aqueous vapor spreads itself by diffusion throughout
the entire cave, and if the outside air is driest, goes to
that. Through this, more ice and water can always be
vaporized, and to the warming elements there is furnished
a cooling one. If dry winds get into the cave, then must
evaporation be very lively and the chilling especially
strong. Through this cause alone can be explained the
remarkably low temperature of +6.3&deg; in the new part of
the Garischen Stollen, in contrast to the temperature of
+7.9&deg; in the old part. The strong draught in the last
drew out through its suction the damp air of the new
adit, so that there had to be a strong evaporation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">« 303 »</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Lohmann gives some exhaustive notes about prismatic
ice. He found it a product of the fall months. He
thinks all the observations show that &ldquo;the beginning of all
prismatic formation in the ice may be looked for in the
changes of temperature in the cave at the time of the
formation of the ice. These cause the everywhere recognized
splitting, vertically to the outer surface. The further
development hangs, as shown by Hagenbach and Emden,
on the attempt of the neighboring cells, to join into larger
unities. The increase of the larger crystals is finally prevented
by the melting out of the openings between the
separate crystals. Through this may be explained the
difference in the prismatic ice in different parts of the
same cave.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Regierungsrath Franz Kraus, in 1895, wrote a short
essay on glacières in <i>Höhlenkunde</i>. He seems to have
seen but few glacières himself, and considers the scientific
side of the question by no means solved as yet. He says:
&ldquo;The last word will not be spoken by the geographers and
the Alpine climbers *  *  * but by the physicists, in
whose field both questions really belong. Only then, when
the physical circumstances of the formation of the ice in
glacières have been so thoroughly understood, that under
the same circumstances it may be possible to build artificial
glacières, only then could one say: the glacière
question is definitely settled. The best proof is always
experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lays down several dicta which he says are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">« 304 »</a></span>
universally recognized, among which is this: &ldquo;2. The ice
formations in the débris heaps of basaltic mountains are
summer ice formations. The evaporation of the infiltration
water is recognized on all sides as the cause of this
ice.&rdquo; I differ in opinion from Herr Kraus about this
matter, and think that, on the contrary, every proof shows
that the ice of basaltic taluses is not a summer formation
and is not due to evaporation.</p>

<p>Herr Kraus also says: &ldquo;The <i>Eishöhlen</i> resemble so
little the <i>Windröhren</i>, that for these a proper name is quite
correct. Just as one cannot draw a sharp line between
<i>Einstürzschlünden</i> and <i>Einstürzdolinen</i>, so one cannot
draw a sharp line between <i>eishöhlen</i> and <i>windröhren</i>. A
stagnation of cave air does not exist, and no cave student
would pretend to say it existed. The circulation
of air may in certain caves take place almost entirely
through the mouth and it then depends largely on the
shape of the latter; in other caves are crevices and
erosion holes, which allow a circulation of air. Again in
other caves air may come through the floor into the
cave, as is proved by certain places always remaining
free from ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also says: "The formation of dripstone is also
diminished about thick roofs, when the cracks are too
broad to permit a slow dripping process. In caves with
sufficient air movements, that is ventilation, the dripstone
formation takes place faster than in those in which the air
is only slowly renewed. Also in such caves, in which the
air is strongly filled with moisture, the dripstone formation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">« 305 »</a></span>
process is materially hindered. Therefore in water
caves and in <i>eishöhlen</i> one finds only rarely dripstone
formations, and these mainly of poor appearance. But in
all cases the carbonic acid of the infiltration water plays
an important part."</p>


<p class="pmt2">In 1896, a Western newspaper published the following
explanation about the presence of ice in the cave
at Elkinsville, Indiana; and it shows how the idea&mdash;long
since exploded&mdash;of the ice being due to chemical
causes, serenely bobs up on the discovery of a new cave:
&ldquo;Some have advanced the theory that the air is forced
through under passages of the earth with such pressure
as to make the strange formation; some have attributed
the cause to an underlying bed of alkali, whose chemical
change to a gaseous form has produced the phenomenon.
Others have thought that the interior heat of the earth,
acting upon the iron pyrites, or fool&rsquo;s gold, which largely
abounds in this country, is the true source of this unparalleled
discovery. Still others think that the sudden expansion
of the carbonic acid gas given off by the heated
limestone, which is also common in this country, could
have easily produced the ice. But thus far the theories
are nothing more than speculation, and further than the
fact that the ice cave exists, and is, indeed, a remarkable
phenomenon, none has been able to further determine.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">In 1896, Dr. A. Cvijic wrote that the cold air of winter
is the source of cold in the glacières of Servia. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">« 306 »</a></span>
mountains have so little water that the shepherds constantly
take the ice out in summer for their own use.</p>


<p class="pmt2">In 1897, numerous newspapers, among others, the
<i>Philadelphia Press</i> of August 1st, romanced as follows
about the cave at Decorah: &ldquo;In the summer its temperature
is far below freezing. *  *  * From some unknown
source in the impenetrable rear of the cave comes a
blast of cold air as chill as from the Arctic region. In
the winter the temperature of the cave is like summer.
*  *  * We followed the winding passage in and out
for more than 1000 feet. *  *  * I took out the thermometer
and laid it upon the floor of the cavern for three
minutes. When I took it up again I found that the
mercury had fallen to 5 degrees below zero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it that causes this phenomenon? Scientific
men are said to have visited the cave within the last day or
two who have declared that it had in some manner a subterranean
connection with the polar regions, and that the
cold air from the North coming in contact with the warm
moist atmosphere from outside converted the vapor into
water on the walls of the cavern where it straightway congealed.
*  *  * It seems to me possible after thinking
the matter over carefully, that in some mysterious manner
the same influences that work the changes in climate in
the Arctic and Antarctic regions are operating in this
cave. It is a well-known fact that in the regions referred
to the seasons are the reverse of what they are
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">« 307 »</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. W. S. Auchincloss writes in 1897: &ldquo;We also
notice the working of the same principle during summer
days. The hottest part does not occur at the noon hour&mdash;when
the sun is on the meridian&mdash;but several hours later
in the afternoon. In this case the accessions of heat arrive
more rapidly than radiation is able to carry off. Radiation,
however, keeps on apace, and, at last attaining the
mastery, temperature falls. Ice caves furnish another example
of the gradual procession in the seasons.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. Alois F. Kovarik writes about Decorah in 1898
that "the length of duration of the ice in the cave during
the spring and summer depends upon the quantity of
cold stored up in the walls and this again upon the coldness
and the length of coldness of the previous winter.
If the winter be severe and long, the walls will store up a
great supply of cold for the gradual dissipation in the
spring and summer and consequently the phenomenon of
the ice in the ice chambers will last longer. Last winter,
with an exception of the fore part of December, was quite
mild. As a result, the ice began to disappear with the
latter part of June, and totally disappeared by the end of
July. *  *  * The time of the lowest temperature in
the cave depends upon how soon the cold spells of the
winter begin; for the sooner the walls begin to freeze to
a greater depth, the sooner have they stored up the
greatest amount of cold. *  *  * February 28th, 1898,
when the walls contained the greatest amount of cold,
there was no ice in the cave, for the reason that no water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">« 308 »</a></span>
made appearance. Could water have appeared, no doubt
a great amount of ice would have formed; but as the conditions
are, the water has to come from the ground outside,
and this being frozen at the time, water could not in
any natural way appear. If in early spring, sufficiently
warm days should come to melt the snow and open the
ground, the water not taken up by the ground would flow
and seep through crevices into the cave and ice consequently
would appear early. Somewhat such conditions
prevailed this year, for warm days appeared quite early in
the spring. If <i>per contra</i> the ground does not open until
in April, as was the case in 1895 and 1896, the appearance
of the ice is consequently delayed. *  *  * Naturally
this opening [the entrance] was small, but to give easier
entrance, it was enlarged to its present size. *  *  *
If the entrance had been left a small opening, as it
naturally was, it is my belief that the temperature of the
interior of the cave would be lower in summer than it is,
and the ice would not disappear as soon as it does."</p>


<p class="pmt2">Mr. Robert Butler, of San José, Cal., investigated the
question of cold air draughts coming from the glacière
cave and from the freezing shaft he examined in Montana.
He wrote to me, in 1898, that he found that one notices
or imagines to notice a draught of air, especially on hot
days. Rapidly walking into the cave from the hot air without
to the rapidly cooling air within produces the same
nervous sensations as though one were to remain stationary
and the air were to pass by from the warm to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">« 309 »</a></span>
colder portions. A distance of twelve meters finds a
difference in temperature of fifteen degrees Centigrade.
Twelve meters can be walked quickly, so quickly that the
nerves cannot become accustomed gradually to the change
of temperature. The rapidly cooling air does actually produce
the sensation of cool air passing by one&rsquo;s face. It
produces somewhat the same sensation as the evaporation
of ether on the surface of the body. Mr. Butler
satisfied himself that as far as he had observed all the
seemingly peculiar conditions and places where the ice
has been found do not indicate any other causes when
carefully investigated than those of the seasons of the
year, and that the ice was formed by no other cause
than the natural cold of winter.</p>


<p class="pmt2">Professor Cranmer, in 1899, added some important contributions
to our knowledge of freezing caverns. All his
work goes to prove the winter&rsquo;s cold theory, but he has
brought out some new details. He found warm and cold
periods in the Tablerloch during the winter months. The
coldest air sank to the bottom and the air in the cave
stratified itself according to its specific gravity and its
temperature. During a cold period, the outside air sank
into the cave only to the air stratum, whose temperature,
from the preceding warm period, was as much higher as
that of the outer air, as this had become warmer in sinking
to that stratum. The air which enters falls down the
slope and displaces an equal volume of air which streams
out under the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">« 310 »</a></span></p>

<p>Water will sometimes drip through a crack in winter
until that crack freezes up, when the water may then find
some other crack to drip through; at this second place
a stalagmite may then grow, while at the first place the
stalagmite may stop growing and even begin to diminish
from evaporation.</p>

<p>Ice begins to form, whenever water gets into a cave,
if the cave temperature is below 0&deg;; ice begins to melt
as soon as the temperature is over 0&deg;.</p>

<p>Professor Cranmer found that occasionally small quantities
of ice form in caves in the summer months: this
was in mountain caves, where there was snow on the
mountains and the temperature of the nights at least,
had sunk below freezing point: in fact when the conditions
were those of the winter months.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
